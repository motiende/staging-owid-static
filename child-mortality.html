class="article-content"><section><p>Since the beginning of the age of the Enlightenment the mortality of children has declined rapidly. Child mortality in rich countries today is much lower than 1%. This is a very recent development and was only reached after a hundredfold decline in child mortality in these countries. In early-modern times, child mortality was very high; in 18th century Sweden every third child died, and in 19th century Germany every second child died. With declining poverty and increasing knowledge and service in the health sector, child mortality around the world is declining very rapidly: Global child mortality fell from 19% in 1960 to just below 4% in 2017; while 4% is still too high, this is a substantial achievement.</p><p>One reason why we do not hear about how global living conditions are improving in the media is that these are the slow processes that never make the headlines: A century ago every third child died before it was five years old, almost a century later the child mortality rate has fallen to 4%. We will not learn about this development from the news as such a slow development is never fast enough to make a headline. The headline that could have been published on every average day in the last century is&#xA0;&#x201C;The global child mortality rate fell by 0.0008 percentage points&#xA0;since yesterday&#x201D;.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Big countries like Brazil and China reduced their child mortality rates 10-fold over the last 4 decades. Other countries &#x2013; especially in Africa &#x2013; still have&#xA0;high child mortality rates, but it&#x2019;s not true that these countries are not making progress. In Sub-Saharan Africa, child mortality has been&#xA0;continuously falling for the last 50 years (1 in 4 children died in the early 60s &#x2013; today it is less than 1 in 10). Over the last decade this improvement has been&#xA0;happening faster than ever before. Rising prosperity, rising education and the spread of health care around the globe are the major drivers of this progress.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries" class="grapherPreview">

How old were they when their lives ended?</p><p>The answer can be seen in the bar chart below. It shows all deaths in the world by age in five-year age groups, starting with the youngest on the left towards the oldest age group (95+ years) on the right.</p><p>What stands out is the death toll for the very youngest age-group. 5.4 million children died before they had their fifth birthday. On any average day, that&#x2019;s 15,000 young children.</p><p>The suffering and dying of children remains immense, yet these daily tragedies continue without receiving the attention this injustice deserves. A comparison of the tragedy of child deaths with those tragedies that do receive public attention puts it in perspective. A large jumbo jet can carry up to 620 passengers.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p> The number of child deaths is that of 24 jumbo jet crashes, with only children on board, every single day.</p><p>Single events &#x2013; such as plane crashes &#x2013; always make the headlines. Daily tragedies &#x2013; even the worst ones like the deaths of thousands of children &#x2013; never make the headlines.</p><p>Every case of a family losing a child is a tragedy, regardless of how common or uncommon the cause. Spectacular events that grab global attention in the media are not more important than everyday human suffering. But unfortunately this is not how our minds and our media work. What we focus our attention on are either the spectacular tragedies (natural disasters, terrorist attacks, crime) or new problems (fake news, risks from automation). The first category keeps the breaking news cycle running, the second category keeps the op-ed writers employed. But in many aspects the biggest threats to our lives are the same threats that all the generations that came before us have faced. And this seems unfortunately to be true for what kills children around the world; it&#x2019;s neither new nor spectacular.</p><p>A newspaper that would cover the most important facts about the last 24 hours would cover the 15,000 child deaths on its cover page every day.</p><p>In <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality">our entry on child mortality</a> we focus on this topic in depth. We ask how the mortality of children has changed over time &#x2013; globally, by world region, by country, and for different groups within countries. We answer what causes the deaths of children and what reduces the risk of death.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

                </figure><p>How likely is it that the world reaches SDG 3.2 and child mortality declines to less than 2.5% everywhere? The visualization below shows five scenarios for the 15-year period of the SDG era to answer this question.</p><p>Stagnation in child health would mean 100 million child deaths in the SDG era. The number of births in the world is <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/peak-child">expected to stagnate</a> between 2015 and 2030 at around 140 million births per year. If we assume the global child mortality rate to remain at the level it was at the beginning of the SDG era (4.5%) then we would live in a world with 6.3 million child deaths every year &#x2013; 100 million child deaths until 2030.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Stagnation, however, is not what global health researchers expect. Based on past trends and levels in 2015 the UN Population Division made projections for the number of births and the mortality rate of children in all countries of the world. According to these projections the number of child deaths will be almost two million lower in 2030 than in a stagnating world: 4.5 million child deaths. This improvement of child health would still mean terrible suffering: 86 million child deaths in the SDG era.</p><p>And while these UN projections expect a further improvement of global child health this trajectory would fall short of reaching the SDG. The scenario in green shows what it would mean to reach the SDGs. In this scenario I made a projection in which all countries would reduce child mortality to at least 2.5% and meet goal 3.2.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> Reaching the SDG would mean again almost 2 million fewer child deaths when compared with the UN projections.</p><p>Some suggest that the UN goals are set in a way that makes them easy to achieve. The motivation is supposedly that the UN defined goals which are easy to reach so that the international organization looks good after achieving them. This is not true.&#xA0;Just how ambitious the child mortality goal is becomes clear when you see it in historical context: The scenario called &#x2018;US path&#x2019; shows what would happen to the global child mortality rate if it would follow the decline of child mortality in the US when the US had a mortality rate of 4.5% (in 1946). And the &#x2018;Western Europe path&#x2019; plays out what would happen if the world would follow the path Western Europe took when it was at that level.</p><p>The SDG goal is much more ambitious than what the richest regions in the world have achieved when they had the same level of child health.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

</div><p>We know that it is possible to change the world. Two hundred years ago the child mortality rate was extremely high around the world &#x2013; <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality-global-overview">more than 40% of all children died</a>. Since then the child mortality rate has declined more than 10-fold. In &#x2018;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/much-better-awful-can-be-better">The world is much better; The world is awful; The world can be much better</a>&#x2018; I&#x2019;ve written about how we can think about the big gap between the current state of the world and what we know is possible and the big gap between the terrible living conditions in the past and the improvements since then. Because we need to further reduce child deaths&#xA0;we are studying the causes of death of children today and how it was possible to improve child health so very substantially in the past&#xA0;in our <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality">entry on child mortality</a>.</p><p>We are currently far away from reaching the global goal for child mortality. Achieving it, however, is tremendously important &#x2013; it would spare millions of families one of the most horrible tragedies anyone can imagine.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p>If you want to know how we are doing on the other Sustainable Development Goals: We recently built&#xA0;<a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/">SDG-Tracker.org</a> to allow everyone to see whether we are reaching the goals or not.</p><h3 id="the-world-is-much-better-the-world-is-awful-the-world-can-be-much-better"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-world-is-much-better-the-world-is-awful-the-world-can-be-much-better"></a>The world is much better; The world is awful; The world can be much better</h3><p>The world is much better. The world is awful. The world can be much better. All three statements are true.<br>Here I focus on child mortality, but the same can be said for many aspects of global development. There are many aspects of development for which it is true that things have improved over time, which are terrible still, and for which we know that things can get better.</p><p><b>The world is awful</b></p><p>In the visualization below I present three scenarios of child deaths. The blue bar represents the actual number of child deaths per year today. Of the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/the-annual-number-of-births-and-deaths-including-the-un-projections-until-2100">141 million children born</a> every year, 3.9% die before their 5th birthday. This means every year 5.5 million children die; on average, 15,000 children die every day.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Clearly, a world where such tragedy happens is an awful world.</p><p><b>The world is much better</b></p><p>The big lesson of history is that things change. The scale of these changes is hard to grasp. The living conditions in today&#x2019;s poorest countries are now in many ways much better than they were even in the richest countries of the past: Child mortality in today&#x2019;s worst off places is<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-1990-vs-2017-slope"> between 10-13%</a>; in all regions of the world it was more than three-times as high [<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality#estimates-for-child-mortality-over-the-last-two-centuries">30-50%</a>] until a few generations ago. At the beginning of the 19th century, it&#x2019;s estimated that 43% of the world&#x2019;s children died by the age of five. If we still suffered the poor health of our ancestors more than 60 million children would die every year; 166,000 every day.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p> This is what the red bar represents in the visualization below.</p><p>If you want to see how child mortality has changed read Hannah Ritchie&#x2019;s post from two days ago:&#xA0;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality-global-overview">From commonplace to rarer tragedy &#x2013; declining child mortality across the world</a></p><p>Such large improvements are not limited to health; the same is true across other aspects (as I show in<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts"> my short history of living conditions</a>). In a number of fundamental aspects (obviously<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/obesity"> not all</a>) we achieved very substantial progress and know that much more is possible. These aspects also include<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-rise-of-education"> education</a>,<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/democracy"> political freedom</a>,<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/homicides"> violence</a>,<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty"> poverty</a>, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hunger-and-undernourishment">nutrition</a>, and <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/ozone-layer">some</a> <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/natural-catastrophes">aspects</a> of environmental change.</p><p>What we learn from this is that it is possible to change the world. I believe that knowing that we can make a difference is one of the most important facts to know about our world.</p><p><b>The world can be much better</b></p><p>Progress over time shows that it was possible to change the world, but what do we know about what is possible for the future? Are we born at that unlucky moment in modern history at which global progress has to come to a halt?</p><p>Studying the global data suggests that the answer is no. One way to see this is to look at those places in the world with the best living conditions. The<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-1990-vs-2017-slope"> inequality</a> in living conditions in the world today shows that there is much work left to do. If health across all countries of the world was equal it would not be possible to really know whether further improvements are possible or how to achieve them. But the fact that some places have already achieved much better child health leaves no doubt: better child health than the global average is not just possibility but already a reality.</p><p>So what would global child mortality be if children around the world would be as well off as the children in those places where children are healthiest today?</p><p>The dark green bar in the visualization shows the answer. The region with the lowest child mortality is the European Union. The average in the European Union (0.41%) is 10-times lower than the global average (3.9%).<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p> In the EU 1-in-250 children die, whilst globally this is 1-in-25. If children around the world would be as well off as children in the EU then 5 million fewer children would die every year.</p><p>Of course, a child mortality rate of 1-in-250 is still too high. It will be a major achievement if the world as a whole catches up to that level of health, but in the healthiest places we should also try to push the boundaries of what has shown to be possible.</p><p>We should certainly not make the mistake of believing that it would be easy to reduce global child mortality rate to that of the EU. For a society to achieve such good health many development aspects have to improve; today&#x2019;s best-off countries achieved two centuries of slow, sustained&#xA0;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/economic-growth">economic growth</a> that bought the infrastructure (housing,<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/water-access-resources-sanitation"> sanitation</a>, public health measures) necessary for good health.</p><p>But while a better world cannot be achieved overnight, from the best-off regions we learn what is possible and in this sense we know that these 5 million annual deaths are preventable. The fact that child mortality in entire world regions is 10-fold lower than in the world as a whole shows us that it is possible to make the world a better place.</p><p><b>The world is terrible, this is why we need to know about positive change</b></p><p>It&#x2019;s easier to scare people than to instill them with confidence and many writers on global development report on how awful the world is. I agree that it is important that we know what is wrong with the world, but given the scale of what we have achieved already and what is possible for the future, I think it&#x2019;s irresponsible to <i>only</i> report on how dreadful our situation is.</p><p>The world is much better. The world is awful. The world can be much better. We have to study the data to know all three perspectives on global living conditions. By studying the world through data these facts are impossible to miss. But the facts of how the world is changing <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/wrong-about-the-world">are not known to most of us</a> because many of the writers that report on how the world is changing do not take the data seriously. This needs to change.</p><p>What we have to achieve as writers on global change is to convey both perspectives at the same: We need to know how terrible the world still is and that a better world is possible. This is what I hope to do. (For example in<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Max-Roser-three-facts-everyone-should-know"> this text</a> from earlier this year that Bill Gates published on his blog).</p><p>If we had achieved the best of all possible worlds I wouldn&#x2019;t spend my life writing and researching about how we got here. What keeps me going is to share the knowledge that change is possible &#x2013; though not inevitable &#x2013; and the wealth of knowledge researchers around the world have brought together on how to make a better world for everyone.</p><p>We know that it is possible to make the world a better place because we already did it. It is because the world is terrible still that it&#x2019;s so important to write about how in several important aspects the world became a better place.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

<section><h2 id="child-mortality-in-the-past"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-mortality-in-the-past"></a>Child mortality in the past</h2><h3 id="mortality-in-the-past-around-half-died-as-children"><a class="deep-link" href="#mortality-in-the-past-around-half-died-as-children"></a>Mortality in the past &#x2013; around half died as children</h3><p>Largely unseen and <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality-everyday-tragedy-no-headlines">rarely reported</a>, the deaths of children are a daily tragedy of immense scale. Globally 4.6% of all children die before they are 15 years old; on average a child dies every 5 seconds today.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>What was the mortality rate in the past? Anthony Volk and Jeremy Atkinson<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> set out to answer this question. They brought together quantitative estimates on mortality at a young age from a wide range of geographic locations and cultures, going back many centuries.</p><p>The authors report mortality rates relative to two different age cut-offs:</p><p>&#x2013; The <i>infant mortality rate</i> measures the share who died in their first year of life.</p><p>&#x2013; The <i>youth mortality rate</i> measures the share who died before reaching &#x201C;approximate sexual maturity at age 15&#x201D;.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p><strong>Historical estimates of mortality</strong></p><p>The chart below shows the historical estimates Volk and Atkinson brought together from a large number of different studies. Shown with the blue marks are estimates of the share of newborns that died in the first year of life &#x2013; the infant mortality rate. And shown with the red marks you see different estimates of the share that never reached adulthood &#x2013; what we here refer to as the &#x2018;youth mortality rate&#x2019;.</p><p>Across the entire historical sample the authors found that on average, 26.9% of newborns died in their first year of life and 46.2% died before they reached adulthood. Two estimates that are easy to remember: Around a quarter died in the first year of life. Around half died as children.</p><p>What is striking about the historical estimates is how similar the mortality rates for children were across this very wide range of 43 historical cultures. Whether in Ancient Rome; Ancient Greece; the pre-Columbian Americas; Medieval Japan or Medieval England; the European Renaissance; or Imperial China: Every fourth newborn died in the first year of life. One out of two died in childhood.</p><p>The available evidence for the mortality rates of children in hunter-gatherer societies and also for our closest relatives &#x2013; Neanderthals and primates &#x2013; I summarize at the end of this post.</p><p>On the very right of the chart you see the statistics on child health in the world today: The global infant mortality rate is now&#xA0;<a href="https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_infant_text/en/">is 2.9%</a>. And 4.6% die before reaching the age of 15.</p><p>The global mortality rates over the course of the 20th century are also shown in the chart. Just as recently as 1950 the global mortality rates were five times higher. We have seen a very&#xA0;steep decline during our lifetimes.</p><p>The chances of survival for a newborn today are around 10-times higher than the past. But some in countries mortality rates are still much higher than the world average. The country with the highest infant mortality rate is the Central African Republic where close to 9% of all infants die.</p><p>The country with the lowest infant mortality rate today is Iceland at 0.16%. The chances of an infant surviving here are 170-times higher than in the past.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

</div><p><strong>Are these high historical mortality rates plausible?</strong></p><p>Even on the basis of many dozen studies we only have some snapshots of the long history of our species. Could they all mislead us to believe that mortality rates were higher than they actually were?</p><p>There is another piece of evidence to consider that suggests the mortality of children was in fact very high in much of humanity&#x2019;s history: birth rates were high, but population growth was close to zero.</p><p>The fertility rate was commonly higher than 6 children per woman on average, as we discuss <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries">here</a>. A fertility rate of 4 children per woman would imply a doubling of the population size each generation; a rate of 6 children per woman would imply a tripling from one generation to the next. But instead population barely increased: From 10,000 BCE to 1700 the world population grew by only <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#long-run-historical-perspective">0.04% annually</a>. A high number of births without a rapid increase of the population can only be explained by one sad reality: a high share of children died before they could have had children themselves.</p><p>Volk and Atkinson also explain that their historical mortality rates &#x201C;should be viewed as conservative estimates that generally err toward underestimating actual historic rates&#x201D;. A first reason is that death records were often not produced for children, especially if children died soon after birth. A second reason they cite is that child burial remains, another important source, are often incomplete &#x201C;due to the more rapid decay of children&#x2019;s smaller physical remains and the lower frequency of elaborate infant burials&#x201D;.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>And lastly, we find that a large number of independent studies for very different societies, locations, and times come to surprisingly similar assessments: all point to very high mortality rates for children. For societies that lived thousands of kilometers away from each other and were separated by thousands of years of history, mortality in childhood was terribly high in all of them. The researchers find that on average a quarter of infants died before their first birthday and half of all children died before they reached puberty.</p><h4 id="during-the-last-century-the-global-mortality-at-a-young-age-declined-10-fold"><a class="deep-link" href="#during-the-last-century-the-global-mortality-at-a-young-age-declined-10-fold"></a>During the last century the global mortality at a young age declined 10-fold</h4><p>How does the historical data compare with the world today?&#xA0;Globally 95.4% of all children survive the first 15 years of life.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p> This is a dramatic change from the past.

In the richest parts of the world deaths of children became very rare.

What about prehistory when our ancestors lived as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a>?</p><p>Good evidence here is much harder to come by. To study mortality at a young age in prehistoric societies the researchers need to mostly rely on evidence from modern hunter-gatherers. Here, one needs to be cautious of how reflective modern societies are of the past. This is because recent hunter-gatherers might have been in exchange with surrounding societies and &#x201C;often currently live in marginalized territories&#x201D;, as the authors say. Both of these could matter for mortality levels.</p><p>To account for this, Volk and Atkinson have attempted to only include hunter-gatherers that are best representative for the living conditions in the past; they limited their sample &#x201C;only to those populations that had not been significantly influenced by contact with modern resources that could directly influence mortality rates, such as education, food, medicine, birth control, and/or sanitation.&#x201D;</p><p>Again, the researchers find very similar mortality rates across their sample of 20 different studies on hunter-gatherer societies from very different locations: The average infant mortality rate (younger than 1) was 26.8% and the average mortality before puberty, 48.8%. Almost exactly the same as the historical sample discussed above.</p><p>All but one of these studied societies are modern hunter-gatherers. The one study on mortality rates of paleolithic hunter-gatherers investigates the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Knoll">Indian Knoll</a> archaeological site from around 2,500 BCE, located in today&#x2019;s area of Kentucky.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p> For this community the estimates suggest that mortality at a young age was even higher than the average for modern-day hunter-gatherers: 30% died in their first year of life, and 56% did not survive to puberty.</p><p><strong>Neanderthals and primates &#x2013; the mortality of our closest relatives</strong></p><p>Going beyond our own species (homo sapiens), researchers have also attempted to measure the mortality rates at young ages for our closest relatives.</p><p>Studies that focussed on the Neanderthals, our very closest relatives who lived within Eurasia from circa 400,000 until 40,000 years ago, suggest that they suffered infant mortality rates similar to our species before modernization: it is estimated that around 28% died in the first year of life.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>Atkinson and Volk also compared human child mortality rates across species with other primates. Bringing together many different sources the authors find the mortality rates of young chimpanzees and gorillas to be similar to the mortality rates of humans of the past, while other primates differ: orangutans and bonobos appear to have somewhat lower mortality rates and baboons, macaques, colobus monkeys, vervet monkeys, lemurs and other primates suffer from higher mortality rates.</p><h3 id="from-commonplace-to-rarer-tragedy-declining-child-mortality-across-the-world"><a class="deep-link" href="#from-commonplace-to-rarer-tragedy-declining-child-mortality-across-the-world"></a>From commonplace to rarer tragedy &#x2013; declining child mortality across the world</h3><p>There are few events more tragic than the loss of a child. It&#x2019;s therefore hard to grasp just how common child deaths were for almost all of our history.</p><p>In the visualization below we&#x2019;ve mapped the estimated child mortality rate &#x2013; the share of children (born alive) who died before reaching their 5th birthday &#x2013; in 1800, 1950 and 2015.</p><p><strong>1800</strong></p><p>Demographic research suggests that through to at least the year 1800 more than one-third of children failed to reach the age of five. Despite estimates in 1800 coming with substantial uncertainty, it&#x2019;s expected that in some countries rates could have been as high as every 2nd child. Let&#x2019;s think about what this meant for parents of this period. The average woman in 1800 <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries" target="_blank">had between 5 to 7 children</a>.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p> Parents probably <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality#how-many-children-did-a-woman-give-birth-to-that-died-before-their-5th-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost 2 or 3 of their children</a> in the first few years of life. Such loss was not a rare occurrence but the norm for most people across the world.</p><p><strong>1950</strong></p><p>By 1950, the outlook has changed dramatically &#x2014; but only for some. For the <a href="https://owid.cloud/entries/economic-growth">richest countries</a> at the time &#x2014; across Europe, Australasia, North America, and some parts of South America &#x2014; child mortality had fallen to less than 5 percent (1-in-20). The <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fertility rate</a> across these countries had also fallen to around 2 to 3 children per woman. Major improvements in living standards, medical knowledge and care, <a href="https://owid.cloud/hunger-and-undernourishment">nutrition</a>, water and sanitation, and treatment of disease had transformed outcomes for mothers and children. For the first time in millennia, most parents would not lose a child. Child mortality was still fairly common, but no longer the norm.</p><p>But 1950 was also a divided world. Child mortality rates across the rest of the world were still unimaginably high. With one-in-three children (sometimes higher) dying in their first few years, most parents across Africa, Asia and much of South America were probably still losing several children.</p><p><strong>2015</strong></p><p>If we fast-forward to 2015 we see how far the world has progressed. Child mortality continued to fall across Europe, North America and Australasia; in 2015 around 1-in-200 children died before their 5th birthday. But the rest of the world has also seen dramatic improvements. Many countries across South America, Asia and Africa have reduced child mortality to 1 to 2 percent (between 1-in-50 and 1-in-100). China reduced child deaths from 1-in-3 to 1-in-100; India from 1-in-4 to 1-in-20; Kenya from 1-in-3 to 1-in-20; and Tanzania from greater than 1-in-3 (40 percent) to 1-in-20. The countries where child mortality is highest today have comparable rates to many countries across Europe in 1950.</p><p>[<em>Clicking on the visualization below will open it in higher resolution</em>].</p><div class="wp-block-image">

A divided world where progress in the richest countries was dynamic, but static and persistently bad elsewhere.</p><p>As the chart below shows, substantial declines in child mortality have occurred across&#xA0;<em>all</em> regions.

<li>global rates fell five-fold from 22.5 percent to 4.5 percent;</li>

The countries are ordered along the x-axis descending by the country&#x2019;s child mortality rate. This makes it possible to see the child mortality rate for each country. Some countries are labelled, but not all. It is also possible to see which share of the world population had a child mortality rate lower than a given level. For the orange line &#x2013; referring to&#xA0;data from 1950-60 &#x2013; we see that close to 70% of the world population have a child mortality rate of higher than 10% back then.<br></em></p><p>For 1800 (red line), you see that the countries on the very left &#x2013; Yemen, India, and others that are not labelled &#x2013;&#xA0;had a child mortality rate higher than 50%. Every second child died before the age of 5. On the very right of the red line you see that in 1800 the best-off countries in the world had a child mortality rate higher than 30%: Every third child died in the countries with the <em>best</em> health.</p><p>Looking at the orange line, you see that in the following 150 years some countries substantially reduced their child mortality rate: 30% of the world population has a child mortality under 10%. Other countries were stuck in poor health: More than half of the world (57%) had child mortality that were still higher than 20%. The world was clearly divided into developed and developing countries. The rapid progress of the industrialized countries had the consequence that the distribution of global health was hugely unequal.</p><p>The latest data refers to 2013. Global health has improved hugely. Particularly those countries that had the worst health in the 1950s experienced the most dramatic improvements. China for example reduced its child mortality from 28.4% to now 1.3%. The consequence of the faster progress in former developing countries is that global health inequality has fallen since the 1950s.</p><p>The global average child mortality rate (weighted population) was 43.3% in 1800 and now fell to 3.4%. Focusing at global inequality we see that in 1800 health was bad around the world, in the 1950s the world became unequal, and today we are back to higher equality but on a much higher level.</p><p>Comparing the position of countries on the red, orange, green and blue lines also makes it possible to see the change in a single countries: In 1800 every second child in South Korea died, in the 1950s the rate was halved (26%), and today it is down to 2.7%.</p><h6>World population by level of child mortality&#xA0;over time, 1800-2013<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

If we look at countries who achieved this in the late 20th or early 21st century, we see that this reduction was much faster. Many (across all regions) achieved this in under 50 years.

Yet there are many daily, recurring tragedies in the world which create as much or more suffering and often go unnoticed.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)</a>&#xA0;estimates that in&#xA0;1990&#xA0;more than&#xA0;12 million children died. Most of these deaths were preventable, and arose from <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality/#child-mortality-by-cause-of-death">illness and poverty</a>.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s put this in perspective. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents">Aviation disasters</a> are a form of tragedy that is both relatively uncommon and widely reported. A Boeing 747&#xA0;can carry up to 620 people.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p> The&#xA0;total number of child deaths in 1990 is equivalent to 53&#xA0;massive aircraft disasters every day, involving primarily children, with no survivors.</p><p>While every plane crash makes the headlines and 53 of them in a single day would have media coverage everywhere, we&#xA0;see proportionally less reporting about the more prevalent causes of mortality. By considering how the unseen, daily cruelty&#xA0;of child death compares to discrete tragic events, we can find a sense of perspective about the scale involved.</p><p>Here at <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/">OurWorldInData.org</a> we present the empirical evidence of global development. To understand these issues and see the progress involved, we need to have a look at long-term changes over the course of history.</p><h4 id="a-ten-fold-decrease-in-child-mortality"><a class="deep-link" href="#a-ten-fold-decrease-in-child-mortality"></a>A ten-fold decrease in child mortality</h4><p>The below chart shows the share of&#xA0;children&#xA0;surviving the first five years of their lives. It goes back to the year 1800. Health conditions in the time of our ancestors were such that more than 4 out of 10 newborns died before their fifth&#xA0;birthday.&#xA0;The historical estimates further suggest that it was the entire world that lived in poor conditions: there was relatively little variation between world regions, and even in the best-off countries of 1800 every third child perished.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries" class="grapherPreview">

The biggest recent improvements were&#xA0;achieved in the countries that were worst off in the 1950s.

Birth complications, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and malaria all still lead to the death of more than 400,000&#xA0;children annually.</p><p>In many cases, the comparison with 1990&#xA0;shows that we are on track to a rapid reduction. But the&#xA0;breakdown by cause also highlights that preventable diseases are still responsible for an&#xA0;unacceptably&#xA0;large share of child deaths and we have the&#xA0;duty and the possibility to reduce child mortality further.</p><h4 id="27-major-plane-crashes-averted-every-day"><a class="deep-link" href="#27-major-plane-crashes-averted-every-day"></a>27 major plane crashes averted every day</h4><p>The achievement that this blog post&#xA0;highlights is that child mortality has decreased substantially. What does this mean in terms of the absolute number of child deaths that we discussed above?</p><p>The number of child deaths declined from over 12 million in 1990 to 5.8 million in 2015 (the year for which we have the latest data).&#xA0;Notably, this decline by 6.3&#xA0;million child deaths happened despite the absolute number of births increasing slightly over the same period.</p><p>6.3 million fewer deaths means that&#xA0;compared with 1990, there are 17,258 fewer child deaths&#xA0;<em>every single day</em>.</p><p>We&#xA0;were also surprised to see the scale of the&#xA0;reduction of child mortality when broken down like this. Over a period of 25 years, in which the number of births had slightly increased, the world was able to reduce the number of child deaths every single day by more than 17,000.

We should still strive to be aware of both. The number of deaths remains very high, but the historical perspective gives us hope that a future where many more children are able to live full lives is possible.</p><h3 id="where-in-the-world-are-children-dying"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-in-the-world-are-children-dying"></a>Where in the world are children dying?</h3><p>5.4 million children under five years old died in 2017. The fact that in those countries with the best health, child mortality rates are 10-times lower than the global average <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/much-better-awful-can-be-better">suggests</a> that most of these child deaths are preventable.</p><p>To reduce the number of children dying we need to know two things: where they&#x2019;re dying and <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality#child-mortality-by-cause-of-death">what they&#x2019;re dying from</a>. Here we take a look at the first question: where in the world are children dying?</p><p>We mapped the global distribution of child deaths in the somewhat unusual visualization below. This type of visualization is called a <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/treemap.html">treemap</a>. Each rectangle&#x2019;s size corresponds to the number of child deaths in a particular region.</p><p>The treemap shows the distribution of child deaths in 1990 and 2017:</p><ul>
<li>The number of child deaths declined in all but 14 countries from 1990 to 2017: for these countries, the outer box represents 1990 and inner box marks 2017.</li>
<li>There are 14 countries where the number of child deaths increased: in this case only a single box is shown, representing deaths in 2017.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
</ul><p>At a time during which the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#how-many-people-die-and-how-many-children-are-born-every-year">number of births increased</a> globally, the number of child deaths fell. In 1990, 12.6 million under-5s died; this <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-child-deaths-have-halved-since-1990">more than halved to 5.4 million</a> until 2017. Every world region also saw a decline.</p><p>Some countries have achieved a dramatic reduction:</p><ul>
<li>In India, the number of child deaths fell from 3.4 million to one million;</li>
<li>In China it fell nine-fold from 1.4 million to less than 160,000;</li>
<li>In Bangladesh more than five-fold from over 500,000 to 100,000;</li>
<li>In Ethiopia from 439,000 to 189,000;</li>

</div><p>But, some of the countries which have seen the greatest progress are still those where most children are dying today. India has suffered the most child deaths: one million in 2017. This was followed by Nigeria (714,000); Pakistan (400,000); the Democratic Republic of Congo (300,000); Ethiopia (189,000); and China (156,000).</p><p>The total number of children dying depends on two factors: the likelihood a newborn will die in the first years of life and the number of children born. Countries where the most children die are not necessarily those where a child&#x2019;s chances of dying are highest. <strong><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-igme">Here</a></strong> is the map of the mortality rate of children. India has a child mortality rate of around 4% &#x2013; the same as the global <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-igme?tab=chart&amp;country=IND+OWID_WRL">average</a> &#x2013; and three times lower than <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-igme">some of the highest countries in the world</a>. But it has, by far, the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/population-under-five-years-old">largest number of children under five years old</a>.</p><p>This matters for the possibility to make progress in the future. India &#x2013; for example &#x2013; doesn&#x2019;t only have a falling child mortality rate, but has also passed &#x2018;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/peak-child">peak child</a>&#x2019;. The number of children under five years old <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/indias-population-growth-will-come-to-an-end">has already peaked</a> and is now falling: in the coming decades, its <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/change-in-under-5s-2015-to-2050">under-5 population will decline</a>. Fewer children and a lower likelihood of child mortality means we&#x2019;d expect the total number of children dying in India to fall quickly.</p><p>Our concern will then turn towards countries where the chances of child mortality is high, and the number of births increasing. Countries where children are <em><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-igme">most likely to die</a></em> &#x2013; Somalia, Chad, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Mali &#x2013; will all have an <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/change-in-under-5s-2015-to-2050">increasing number of children</a> in the coming decades. Progress on reducing child deaths will here therefore become a race between declining child mortality rates and an increasing number of children.</p><p>But the two runners in the race are not independent: <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate#increasing-well-being-and-status-of-children">one of the reasons</a> couples have many children is because they do &#x2013; or expect to &#x2013; lose some of them early in life. Our progress on reducing child deaths can therefore be amplified if falling child mortality leads to falling <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate">fertility rates</a>.</p><p>We know that most child deaths today are preventable. They result from causes we know we can tackle. How do we know this? Because we already averted many millions of child deaths in the past few decades. Between 1990 and 2017 the number of children dying each year fell by 7.2 million. By stopping those we know are preventable, we <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/much-better-awful-can-be-better">could save at least another 5 million children</a> every year. We can reach a world with many fewer child deaths than ever <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality-in-the-past">before</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-children-dying-from"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-children-dying-from"></a>What are children dying from?</h3><h4 id="the-leading-causes-of-child-death-globally"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-leading-causes-of-child-death-globally"></a>The leading causes of child death &#x2013; globally</h4><p>In the chart below we see the major causes&#xA0;of&#xA0;death&#xA0;of&#xA0;children under 5 in 2017 compared to 1990.

One study of maternal-child outcomes across 55 countries found that poor health was highest for the youngest mothers, and continued to improve with age until 27 years old<a id="ref-40" class="ref" href="#note-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p><p> The relationship between child mortality and the prevalence of teenage pregnancy is shown in the chart below: countries with low child mortality tend to have fewer teenage mothers.</p><p>There are both biological and social factors which affect why health outcomes are poorest for the youngest mothers. This can be the direct result of more challenging pregnancy, childbirth or poor physical development of an infant; but can also be associated with other determinants. Maternal education plays an important role here: educational and employment opportunities may be important mechanisms for women delaying the age of first birth. Delaying childbirth until the early 20s is expected to greatly reduce the risk of child mortality or other adverse health outcomes.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-vs-teenage-pregnancy" class="grapherPreview">

</div><p>Below we can see that a higher educational attainment by mothers is associated with lower child mortality rates within countries. For instance, Niger has the highest national average of child mortality, but within the country, mothers with a secondary school education or higher experience child mortality rates that are lower than the national averages of the next 16 countries listed.</p><p>The effect of education on child mortality is huge. Especially in places with relatively little education, the prospects for extending education are promising. In 2008, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years died in sub-Sahran Africa.

On the x-axis we measure how many infants, who were born alive, survive their 1st year of life &#x2013; this is the <em>infant survival rate.</em></p><p>The chart shows how these two aspects changed over the course of the 20th century: At the beginning of the century all 4 countries can be found in the upper left corner &#x2013; they are characterized by high fertility and an infant survival rate below 85%. If we follow the 4 lines we are taken to the bottom right corner and see that women have fewer children when the mortality rate of babies goes down.</p><p>The causal link between infant survival and fertility is established in both directions: Firstly, increasing infant survival reduces the parents&#x2019; demand for children. And secondly, a decreasing fertility allows the parents to devote more attention and resources to their children.</p><p>This link between fertility and child mortality is an immensely important insight and tells us what drives the acceleration and slowdown of population growth: In the initial stage of the transition, when fertility rates are still high but health is already improving, the population starts to grow. But then, a bit later, we see that this transition works to decrease population growth since improving health of the children leads to lower fertility. It is an important part of the mechanism behind the <a href="/world-population-growth/#the-demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>.</p><p>A very cynical view is that a decrease in child mortality is bad for the world since it would contribute to the overpopulation of the planet. The chart above shows that this opinion is not just&#xA0;contemptuous of human life but plainly wrong: When more infants survive fertility goes down and the temporary population growth comes to an end. If we want to ensure that the world&#x2019;s population increase comes to an end soon we must work to increase child survival.</p><h6>Infant survival and fertility through time &#x2013; Max Roser<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

<p>There is uncertainty in the estimates for the latest level of child mortality. The IGME source used here estimates that in 2015 the child mortality rate <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was 4.2%</a>&nbsp;while the UN Population Division – which I rely on below – estimated global child mortality in 2015 to be 4.5% [<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-around-the-world">here is the UN data</a>].</p>
<p>The number of annual child deaths is the global child mortality rate multiplied with the global number of births: 0.0391*140,949,089 = 5,511,109 child deaths</p>
<p>Child deaths per day: 5,511,109/365= 15,099</p>
<p>Child deaths per minute: 15,099/24/60= 10.49</p>
<p>The global child mortality rate is 3.91%</p>
<p>Total number of births in 2017: 140,949,089</p>
<p>The number of global births is almost constant, so I have taken the 2017 as the average for the relevant 5-year window.</p>
<p>Data on the global child mortality rate: <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort</a></p>
<p>Data on the number of births: <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/births-and-deaths-projected-to-2100">https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/births-and-deaths-projected-to-2100</a> </p></li><li id="note-5"><p>The average number of deaths per year in a world stagnating at an under-5-mortality-rate of 4.5% would be 6,311,793. Over a 16-year time frame this would mean 100,988,688 child deaths.</p></li><li id="note-6"><p>For all countries for which the UN projects a child mortality of less than 2.5% I relied on the UN projections. For all countries for which the UN projects a child mortality rate higher than 2.5% however I modeled here what it would look like if the mortality rate would decline to 2.5%. I then multiplied the number of expected births with the mortality rate projections to arrive at the total number of child deaths.</p></li><li id="note-7"><p>Child deaths in 2017: 140.95 * (3.9/100)=5,497,050. This means 5,497,050/365.25=15,050 child deaths per day. Here I’m assuming that the cohorts of children younger than 5 are all equally large. As the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/the-annual-number-of-births-and-deaths-including-the-un-projections-until-2100">number of births per year is not rising much anymore</a>, this seems like a justified approximation that makes the calculation straightforward.</p></li><li id="note-8"><p>How many children actually died at the time we don’t know because there I don’t have estimates of the number of births globally at the time. For the 1950s and 1960s we have estimates of both the number of births and the mortality rate and the records show that around 20 million children died every year. See the data shown <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Max-Roser-three-facts-everyone-should-know">here</a>.</p></li><li id="note-9"><p>Of the 46 different world regions for which the World Bank publishes average child mortality, the Euro area has the lowest and the EU the second lowest child mortality rate.</p>
<p>If we look at single countries this difference becomes even more striking as in the countries with the best health the child mortality rate is again almost twice as low as in the EU as a whole.</p>
<p>The country with the lowest child mortality rate today is Iceland where 1 of 476 newborns (0.21%) dies as a child.</p>
<p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-1990-vs-2017-slope">This chart</a> shows the ranking.</p>
<p>Iceland however as a very small country has very few children. Per year only <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/the-annual-number-of-births-and-deaths-including-the-un-projections-until-2100?country=ISL">4,500 children are born on the island</a>.</p>
<p>At the mortality rate of 0.21% this means that 9 newborns will die as children.&nbsp;[4425 newborns*(0.21/100)=9.3 newborns]</p>
<p>Because of this very small sample I relied in this discussion not on the single country with the best child health, but on a large world region like the EU where millions of children are born every year.</p></li><li id="note-10"><p> 6.3 million children under 15 years of age died in 2017. 5.4 million of these children were younger than five years old. Because of this the &#8216;child mortality rate&#8217; is usually defined as the share of children dying before they are five years old. In this post childhood is defined in the common use as the period until the end of puberty (and not only as the first five years of life as it is often defined in modern health statistics).<br> All data from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Child-Mortality-Report-2018.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1558918433962000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPd5xwrhdGIdmG4apFxoHvzgKyRA" target="_blank">https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Child-Mortality-Report-2018.pdf</a> </p></li><li id="note-11"><p>Anthony A.Volk Jeremy A.Atkinson (2013) – Infant and child death in the human environment of evolutionary adaptation.

This mortality rate in the first 5 years of life is not reported by Volk and Atkinson.</p>
<p>The mortality up to the end of puberty is less commonly reported in modern health statistics.
