create the &#x2018;greenhouse effect&#x2019; which warms the earth&#x2019;s climate. These gases &#x2013; carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide, methane, and others &#x2013; are important in sustaining a habitable temperature for the planet: if there were absolutely no greenhouse gases (GHGs), the average surface temperature of the Earth would be about -18 degrees celsius.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Since the Industrial Revolution, however, energy-production, that largely relied on <a href="https://owid.cloud/fossil-fuels">fossil fuels</a>, has led to a rapid increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which leads to global warming. The changing climate has a range of potential ecological, physical and health impacts, including extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, storms, and heatwaves); sea-level rise; altered crop growth; and disrupted water systems. The most extensive source of analysis on the potential impacts of climatic change can be found in the <em>5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change </em>(IPCC) report; this presents full coverage of all impacts in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/" target="_blank">its chapter on</a>&#xA0;Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>In light of this evidence, UN member parties have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unfccc.int/news/raising-climate-ambition-essential-for-2-degrees-c-goal-economist-nicholas-stern" target="_blank">set a target</a>, in the <em>Paris Agreement</em>, of limiting average warming to 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.</p><p>This entry provides a historical perspective of how CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions have evolved, how emissions are distributed, and the key factors that both drive these trends and hold the key to mitigating climate change.</p><h4 id="global-average-temperatures-since-1850"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-average-temperatures-since-1850"></a>Global average temperatures since 1850</h4><p>To set the scene, let&#x2019;s look at how the planet has warmed. In the chart we see the global average temperature relative to the average of the period between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>The red&#xA0;line represents the average annual temperature trend through time, with upper and lower confidence intervals shown in light grey. </p><p>We see that over the last few decades, global temperatures have risen sharply&#xA0;&#x2014; to approximately 0.8 degrees celsius higher than our 1961-1990 baseline. When extended&#xA0;back to 1850, we see that temperatures then were a further 0.4 degrees colder than they were in our 1961-1990 baseline. Overall, if we look at the total temperature increase since pre-industrial times, this amounts to approximately 1.2 degrees celsius. </p><p>In this chart you can also view these changes by hemisphere (North and South), as well as the tropics (defined as 30 degrees above and below the equator). This shows us that the temperature increase in the North Hemisphere is higher, at closer to 1.4&#xA0;degrees celsius since 1850, and less in the Southern Hemisphere (closer to 0.8 degrees celsius). Evidence suggests that this distribution is strongly related to ocean circulation patterns (notably the North Atlantic Oscillation) which has resulted in greater warming in the northern hemisphere.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/temperature-anomaly" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="per-capita-co2-emissions"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-co2-emissions"></a>Per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h2><p>Where in the world does the average person emit the most carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) each year?</p><p>We can calculate the contribution of the average citizen of each country by dividing its total emissions by its population. This gives us CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita. In the visualization below we see the differences in per capita emissions across the world.&#xA0;</p><p>Here we look at production-based emissions &#x2013; that is, emissions produced within a country&#x2019;s boundaries without accounting for how goods are traded across the world. In our post on <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-embedded-in-trade">consumption-based emissions</a> we look at how these figures change when we account for trade. Production figures matter &#x2013; these are the numbers that are taken into account for climate targets<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> &#x2013; and thanks to <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/contributed-most-global-co2">historical reconstructions</a> they are available for the entire world since the mid 18th century.</p><p>There are very large inequalities in per capita emissions across the world.&#xA0;</p><p>The world&#x2019;s largest per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emitters are the major <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fossil-fuels#oil-production-by-country">oil producing countries</a>; this is particularly true for those with relatively low <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#population-growth-by-country">population size</a>. Most are in the Middle East: In 2017 Qatar had the highest emissions at 49 tonnes (t) per person, followed by Trinidad and Tobago (30t); Kuwait (25t); United Arab Emirates (25t); Brunei (24t); Bahrain (23t) and Saudi Arabia (19t).</p><p>Many of the major oil producers have relatively a relatively low population size meaning their total <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/annual-co2-emissions">annual emissions</a> are low, however. More populous countries with some of the highest per capita emissions &#x2013; and therefore high <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/annual-co2-emissions">total emissions</a> &#x2013; are the United States, Australia, and Canada. Australia has an average per capita footprint of 17 tonnes, followed by the US at 16.2 tonnes, and Canada at 15.6 tonnes.</p><p>This is more than 3 times higher than the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;country=USA+OWID_WRL+CAN+AUS">global average</a>, which in 2017 was 4.8 tonnes per person.</p><p>Since there is such a <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-emissions-and-prosperity">strong relationship</a> between income and per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we&#x2019;d expect this to be the case: that countries with high standards of living would have a high carbon footprint. But what becomes clear is that there can be large differences in per capita emissions, even between countries with similar standards of living. Many countries across Europe, for example, have much lower emissions than the US, Canada or Australia.&#xA0;</p><p>In fact, some European countries have emissions not far from the global average: In 2017 emissions in Portugal are 5.3 tonnes; 5.5t in France; and 5.8t per person in the UK. This is also much lower than some of their neighbours with similar standards of living, such as Germany, the Netherlands, or Belgium. The choice of energy sources plays a key role here: in the UK, Portugal and France, a much higher share of electricity is produced from nuclear and renewable sources &#x2013; you can explore this electricity mix by country <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-electricity-by-source?country=FRA"><strong>here</strong></a>. This means a much lower share of electricity is produced from fossil fuels: in 2015, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-electricity-production-from-fossil-fuels?country=FRA">only 6%</a> of France&#x2019;s electricity came from fossil fuels, compared to <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-electricity-production-from-fossil-fuels?country=DEU">55% in Germany</a>.</p><p>Prosperity is a primary driver of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but clearly policy and technological choices make a difference.</p><p>Many countries in the world still have very low per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In many of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa &#x2013; such as Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic &#x2013; the average footprint is around 0.1 tonnes per year. That&#x2019;s more than 160 times lower than the USA, Australia and Canada. In just 2.3 days the average American or Australian emits as much as the average Malian or Nigerien in a year.&#xA0;</p><p>This inequality in emissions across the world I explored in more detail in my post, &#x2018;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/share-co2-emissions">Who emits more than their share of CO</a><sub><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/share-co2-emissions">2</a></sub><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/share-co2-emissions"> emissions?</a>&#x2019;</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="annual-co2-emissions"><a class="deep-link" href="#annual-co2-emissions"></a>Annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h2><p>Who emits the most CO<sub>2</sub> each year? In the treemap visualization below we show annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by country, and aggregated by region. Treemaps are used to compare entities (such as countries or regions) in relation to others, and relative to the total. Here each inner rectangle represents a country &#x2013; which are then nested and colored by region. The size of each rectangle corresponds to its annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2017. Combined, all rectangles represent the global total.</p><p>The emissions shown here relate to the country where CO<sub>2</sub> is produced (i.e.production-based CO<sub>2</sub>) , not to where the goods and services that generate emissions are finally consumed. We look at the difference in each country&#x2019;s production vs. consumption (trade-adjusted) emissions <strong><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#production-vs-consumption-based-emissions-over-time">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Asia is by far the largest emitter, accounting for 53% of global emissions. As it is <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820?stackMode=relative">home to 60%</a> of the world&#x2019;s population this means that per capita emissions in Asia are slightly lower than the world average, however.</p><p>China is, by a significant margin, Asia&#x2019;s and the world&#x2019;s largest emitter: it emits nearly 10 billion tonnes each year, more than one-quarter of global emissions.</p><p>North America &#x2013; dominated by the USA &#x2013; is the second largest regional emitter at 18% of global emissions. It&#x2019;s followed closely by Europe with 17%. Here we have grouped the 28 countries of the European Union together, since they typically negotiate and <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/">set targets</a> as a collective body. You can see the data for individual EU countries in the interactive maps which follow.</p><p>Africa and South America are both fairly small emitters: accounting for 3-4% of global emissions each. Both have emissions almost equal in size to international aviation and shipping. Both aviation and shipping are not included in national or regional emissions. This is because of disagreement over how emissions which cross country borders should be allocated: do they belong to the country of departure, or country of origin? How are connecting flights accounted for? The tensions in reaching international aviation and shipping deals are discussed in detail at the Carbon Brief <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-will-countries-finally-agree-climate-deal-for-shipping"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap-611x550.png" alt="Annual co2 emissions treemap" class="wp-image-25249" srcset="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap-611x550.png 611w, https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap-150x135.png 150w, https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap-400x360.png 400w, https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2019/10/Annual-CO2-emissions-Treemap-768x692.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px"></a></figure><h4 id="how-did-co2-emissions-change-over-time"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-did-co2-emissions-change-over-time"></a>How did CO<sub>2</sub> emissions change over time?</h4><p>The same data is also explorable by country and over time in the interactive map below.&#xA0;</p><p>By clicking on any country you can see how its annual emissions have changed, and compare it with other countries.</p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p><h4 id="share-of-global-co2-emissions-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#share-of-global-co2-emissions-by-country"></a>Share of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by country</h4><p>In the interactive chart below you can explore each country&#x2019;s <em>share</em> of global emissions. Using the timeline at the bottom of the map, you can see how the global distribution has changed since 1751. By clicking on any country you can see its evolution and compare it with others.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re interested in which countries emit more or less than their &#x2018;fair share&#x2019; based on their share of global population, you can explore this <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/share-co2-emissions"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>The distribution of emissions has changed significantly over time. The UK was &#x2013; until 1888, when it <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-share-of-co2-emissions?tab=chart&amp;year=1890&amp;country=GBR+USA">was overtaken</a> by the US &#x2013; the world&#x2019;s largest emitter. This was because the UK was the first country to industrialize, a transition which later contributed to in massive improvements in living standards for much of its population.&#xA0;</p><p>Whilst rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have clear negative environmental consequences, it is also true that they have historically been a by-product of positive improvements in human living conditions. But, it&#x2019;s also true that reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is important to protect the living conditions of future generations. This perspective &#x2013; that we must consider both the environmental and human welfare implications of emissions &#x2013; is important if we are to build a future that is both sustainable and provides high standards of living for everyone.&#xA0;</p><p>Rising emissions and living standards in North America and Oceania followed soon after developments in the UK.</p><p>Many of the world&#x2019;s largest emitters today are in Asia. However, Asia&#x2019;s rapid rise in emissions has only occurred in very recent decades. This too has been a by-product of massive improvements in living standards: since 1950 life expectancy in Asia <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/life-expectancy?time=1770..2019&amp;country=Asia">has increased</a> from 41 to 74 years; it has seen a dramatic <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-the-population-living-in-extreme-poverty?tab=chart&amp;time=1981..2015&amp;country=East%20Asia%20%26%20Pacific+South%20Asia">fall in extreme poverty</a>; and for the first time most of its population <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-long-run?tab=chart&amp;country=IND+CHN+BGD+JPN+KOR">received formal education</a>.</p><p>Whilst all countries must work collectively, action from the very top emitters will be essential. China, the USA and the 28 countries of the EU account for more than half of global emissions. Without commitment from these largest emitters, the world will not come close to meeting its global targets.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-share-of-co2-emissions" class="grapherPreview">

One common argument is that those countries which have added most to the CO<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere &#x2013; contributing most to the problem today &#x2013; should take on the greatest responsibility in tackling it. </p><p>We can compare each country&#x2019;s total contribution to global emissions by looking at <em>cumulative</em> <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em>. We can calculate cumulative emissions by adding up each country&#x2019;s annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over time. We did this calculation for each country and region over the period from 1751 through to 2017.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> </p><p>The distribution of cumulative emissions around the world is shown in the treemap below. Treemaps are used to compare entities (such as countries or regions) in relation to others, and relative to the total. Here countries are presented as rectangles and colored by region. The size of each rectangle corresponds to the sum of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from a country between 1751 and 2017. Combined, all rectangles represent the global total.</p><p>There are some key points we can learn from this perspective:</p><ul>
<li>the United States has emitted more CO<sub>2</sub> than any other country to date: at around 400 billion tonnes since 1751, it is responsible for 25% of historical emissions;</li>
<li>this is twice more than China &#x2013; the world&#x2019;s second largest national contributor;&#xA0;</li>
<li>the 28 countries of the European Union (EU-28) &#x2013; which are grouped together here as they typically negotiate and <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/">set targets</a> on a collaborative basis &#x2013; is also a large historical contributor at 22%;</li>
<li>many of the large annual emitters today &#x2013; such as India and Brazil &#x2013; are not large contributors in a historical context;</li>
<li>Africa&#x2019;s regional contribution &#x2013; relative to its <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820?stackMode=relative">population size</a> &#x2013; has been very small.

Using the timeline at the bottom of the chart you can see how contribution across the world has evolved since 1751. By clicking on a country you can see an individual country&#x2019;s cumulative contribution over time.</p><p>The map for 2017 shows the large inequalities of contribution across the world that the first treemap visualization has shown. The USA has emitted most to date: more than a quarter of all historical CO<sub>2</sub>: twice that of China which is the second largest contributor. In contrast, most countries across Africa have been responsible for less than 0.01% of all emissions over the last 266 years.&#xA0;</p><p>What becomes clear when we look at emissions across the world today is that the countries with the highest emissions over history are not always the biggest emitters today. The UK, for example, was responsible for only <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-share-of-co2-emissions?tab=chart&amp;country=GBR">1% of global emissions</a> in 2017. Reductions here will have a relatively small impact on emissions at the global level &#x2013; or at least fall far short of the scale of change we need. This creates tension with the argument that the largest contributors in the past should be those doing most to reduce emissions today. This is because a large fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years once emitted.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>This inequality is one of the main reasons which makes international agreement on who should take action so challenging.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-cumulative-co2" class="grapherPreview">

This accounting method &#x2013; which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;territorial&#x2019; emissions &#x2013; is used when countries report their emissions, and set targets domestically and internationally.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>In addition to the commonly reported production-based emissions statisticians also calculate &#x2018;consumption-based&#x2019; emissions. These emissions are adjusted for <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/trade-and-globalization">trade</a>. To calculate consumption-based emissions we need to track which goods are traded across the world, and whenever a good was imported we need to include all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that were emitted in the production of that good, and vice versa to subtract all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that were emitted in the production of goods that were exported.</p><p>Consumption-based emissions reflect the consumption and lifestyle choices of a country&#x2019;s citizens.</p><h4 id="which-countries-in-the-world-are-net-importers-of-emissions-and-which-are-net-exporters"><a class="deep-link" href="#which-countries-in-the-world-are-net-importers-of-emissions-and-which-are-net-exporters"></a>Which countries in the world are net importers of emissions and which are net exporters?</h4><p>In the interactive map below we see the emissions of traded goods.

<li>Countries shown in red are net importers of emissions &#x2013; they import more CO<sub>2</sub> embedded in goods than they export. <br><br>For example, the USA has a value of 7.7% meaning its net import of CO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to 7.7% of its domestic emissions. This means emissions calculated on the basis of &#x2018;consumption&#x2019; are 7.7% higher than their emissions based on production.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Countries shown in blue are net exporters of emissions &#x2013; they import more CO<sub>2</sub> embedded in goods than they export. <br><br>For example, China&#x2019;s value of -14% means its net export of CO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to 14% of its domestic emissions.

This tells us that more CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted in the production of the goods that Americans import than in those products Americans export.</p><p>The opposite is true for China: its consumption-based emissions <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co-emissions-in-imported-goods-as-a-share-of-domestic-emissions">are 14% lower</a> than its production-based emissions. On a per capita basis, the respective measures are 6.9 and 6.2 tonnes per person in 2016. A difference, but smaller than what many expect.&#xA0;</p><p>Whilst China is a large CO<sub>2</sub> emissions exporter, it is no longer a large emitter <em>because</em> it produces goods for the rest of the world. This was the case in the past, but today, even adjusted for trade, China now has a per capita footprint <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/consumption-co2-per-capita-equity">higher than</a> the global average (which is 4.8 tonnes per capita in 2017). In the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/consumption-based-co2#additional-information">Additional Information</a> you find an interactive map of how consumption-based emissions per capita vary across the world.</p><p>The comparisons below provide the answer to the question whether countries have only achieved emissions reductions by offshoring emissions intensive production to other countries. If only production-based emissions were falling whilst consumption-based emissions were rising, this would suggest it was &#x2018;offshoring&#x2019; emissions elsewhere.</p><p>There are some countries where this is the case. Examples where production-based emissions have stagnated whilst consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub> steadily increased include Ireland <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions?country=IRL">in the early 2000s</a>; Norway <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions?country=NOR">in the late 1990s</a> and early 2000s; and Switzerland <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions?country=CHE">since 1990</a>.</p><p>On the other hand there are several very rich countries where both production- <em>and</em> consumption-based emissions have declined. This has been true, among others, for the UK (<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prod-cons-co2-per-capita?country=GBR">chart</a>), France (<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prod-cons-co2-per-capita?country=FRA">chart</a>), Germany (<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prod-cons-co2-per-capita?country=DEU">chart</a>), and the USA (<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prod-cons-co2-per-capita?country=USA">chart</a>). These countries have achieved some genuine reductions without outsourcing the emissions to other countries. Emissions are still too high in all of these countries, but it shows that genuine reductions are possible.</p><p>In most countries emissions increased when countries <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita-international-">become richer</a>, but this is also not necessarily the case: by comparing the change in consumption-based emissions and economic growth we see that <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/consumption-co2-per-capita-vs-gdppc?endpointsOnly=1&amp;time=1990..2016&amp;country=BGR+CYP+CZE+DNK+EST+FIN+FRA+DEU+GRC+HUN+ITA+LVA+LTU+NLD+POL+PRT+ROU+RUS+SVK+ESP+SWE+GBR+USA+CAN+BHR">many countries</a> have become much richer while achieving a reduction of emissions.&#xA0;</p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prod-cons-co2-per-capita" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><h4 id="additional-information"><a class="deep-link" href="#additional-information"></a>Additional Information</h4><h4 id="absolute-emissions-imported-or-exported-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#absolute-emissions-imported-or-exported-by-country"></a>Absolute emissions imported or exported by country</h4><p>In the interactive map below you see each country&#x2019;s net imports or exports of CO<sub>2</sub> each year, as measured in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Countries which are net importers are shown in red (and given as positive values), with net exporters shown in blue (given as negative values).</p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co-emissions-embedded-in-global-trade" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p><h4 id="consumption-based-co2-emissions-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#consumption-based-co2-emissions-by-country"></a>Consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by country</h4><p>In the interactive map below we see how consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vary across the world.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/consumption-co2-emissions" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p><h4 id="consumption-based-co2-emissions-per-capita"><a class="deep-link" href="#consumption-based-co2-emissions-per-capita"></a>Consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita</h4><p>In the visualization below we show how consumption-based emissions corrected for <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth">population</a> size &#x2013; emissions per capita &#x2013; varies across the world. </p><p><iframe src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/consumption-co2-per-capita" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe></p></section>



































<section><h2 id="co2-emissions-by-fuel"><a class="deep-link" href="#co2-emissions-by-fuel"></a>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by fuel</h2><p>Carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy and industrial production can come from a range of fuel types. The contribution of each of these sources has changed significantly through time, and still shows large differences by region. In the chart below we see the absolute and relative contribution of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by source, differentiated between gas, liquid (i.e. oil), solid (coal and biomass), flaring, and cement production.</p><p>At a global level we see that early industrialisation was dominated by the use of solid fuel&#x2014;this is best observed by switching to the &#x2018;relative&#x2019; view in the chart. Coal-fired power at an industrial-scale was the first to emerge in Europe and North America during the 1700s. It wasn&#x2019;t until the late 1800s that we begin to see a growth in emissions from oil and gas production. Another century passed before emissions from flaring and cement production began. In the present day, solid and liquid fuel dominate, although contributions from gas production are also notable. Cement and flaring at the global level remain comparably small.</p><p>You can also view these trends across global regions in the chart below, by clicking on &#x2018;change region&#x2019;. The trends vary significantly by region. Overall patterns across Europe and North America are similar: early industrialisation began through solid fuel consumption, however, through time this energy mix has diversified. Today, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are spread fairly equally between coal, oil and gas. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean&#x2019;s emissions have historically been and remain a product of liquid fuel&#x2014;even in the early stages of development coal consumption was small.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>&#xA0;Asia&#x2019;s energy remains dominant in solid fuel consumption, and has notably higher cement contributions relative to other regions.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>&#xA0;Africa also has more notable emissions from cement and <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flaring</a>; however, its key sources of emissions are a diverse mix between solid, liquid and gas.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/CO2-by-source" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="atmospheric-ghg-concentrations"><a class="deep-link" href="#atmospheric-ghg-concentrations"></a>Atmospheric GHG concentrations</h2><h4 id="atmospheric-co2-concentrations"><a class="deep-link" href="#atmospheric-co2-concentrations"></a>Atmospheric CO<sub>2&#xA0;</sub>concentrations</h4><p>The large growth in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions has had a significant impact on the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. If we look at atmospheric concentrations <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/roser/graphs/2000YearsCO2concentration/2000YearsCO2concentration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the past 2000 years</a> (see the Data Quality and Measurement section in this entry for explanation on how we estimate historical emissions), we see that levels were fairly stable at 270-285 parts per million (ppm) until the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Since the Industrial Revolution, global CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been increasing rapidly.</p><p>However, CO<sub>2</sub> is not the only GHG we&#x2019;re concerned about&#x2014;emissions of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) have also been increasing rapidly through agricultural, energy, and industrial sources. Like CO<sub>2</sub>, the atmospheric concentration of both of these gases has also <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/roser/graphs/2000YearsNH4andN2Oconcentration/2000YearsNH4andN2Oconcentration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been rising rapidly</a>.</p><p>Has a global stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions&#xA0;over the last few years&#xA0;had an impact on global atmospheric concentrations? While it appears progress is being made on global emissions, atmospheric concentrations continue to rise, as shown below. Atmospheric concentrations have now broken the 400ppm threshold&#x2014;<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/05/130510-earth-co2-milestone-400-ppm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considered its highest level</a> in the last three&#xA0;million years.&#xA0;To begin to stabilise&#x2014;or even reduce&#x2014;atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, our emissions need to not only stabilise but also decrease significantly.</p><p>Why would a stabilization in CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions not directly translate into the same for atmospheric concentrations? This is because CO<sub>2</sub> accumulates in the atmosphere based on what we call a &#x2018;residence time&#x2019;. Residence time is the time required for emitted CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;to be removed from the atmosphere through natural processes in Earth&#x2019;s carbon cycle. The length of this time&#xA0;can vary&#x2014;some CO<sub>2</sub> is removed in less than 5 years through fast cycling processes, meanwhile other processes, such as absorption through land vegetation, soils and cycling into the deep ocean can take hundreds to thousands of years. If we stopped emitting CO<sub>2</sub> today, it would take several hundred years before the majority of human emissions were removed from the atmosphere.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-co2-concentration-ppm" class="grapherPreview">

There are a range of greenhouse gases, which include methane, nitrous oxide, and a range of smaller concentration trace gases such as the so-called group of &#x2018;F-gases&#x2019;.</p><p>Greenhouse gases vary in their relative contributions to global warming; i.e. one tonne of methane does not have the same impact on warming as one tonne of carbon dioxide. We define these differences using a metric called &#x2018;Global Warming Potential&#x2019; (GWP). GWP can be defined on a range of time-periods, however the most commonly used (and that adopted by the IPCC) is the 100-year timescale (GWP<sub>100</sub>).<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>In the chart below we see the GWP<sub>100</sub> value of key greenhouse gases relative to carbon dioxide. The GWP<sub>100</sub> metric measures the relative warming impact one molecule or unit mass of a greenhouse gas relative to carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale. For example, one tonne of methane would have 28 times the warming impact of tonne of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. GWP<sub>100</sub> values are used to combine greenhouse gases into a single metric of emissions called carbon dioxide equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e). CO<sub>2</sub>e is derived by multiplying the mass of emissions of a specific greenhouse gas by its equivalent GWP<sub>100</sub> factor. The sum of all gases in their CO<sub>2</sub>e form provide a measure of total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-warming-potential-of-greenhouse-gases-over-100-year-timescale" class="grapherPreview">

Firstly, a&#xA0;<a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth/">growing global population</a> requires an overall higher food production.

<section><h2 id="future-emission-scenarios"><a class="deep-link" href="#future-emission-scenarios"></a>Future emission scenarios</h2><p>What does the future of our carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions look like. In the chart below we show a range of potential future scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions (measured in gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents), based on data from&#xA0;<a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Action Tracker</a>. Interactive data of these pathways can be <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/future-greenhouse-gas-emission-scenarios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a>. Here, five scenarios are shown:</p><ul>
<li><strong>No climate policies</strong>: projected future emissions if no climate policies were implemented; this would result in an estimated 4.1-4.8&#xB0;C warming by 2100 (relative to pre-industrial temperatures)</li>
<li><strong>Current climate policies</strong>: projected warming of 3.1-3.7&#xB0;C by 2100 based on current implemented climate policies</li>
<li><strong>National pledges</strong>: if all countries achieve their current targets/pledges set within the Paris climate agreement, it&#x2019;s estimated average warming by 2100 will be 2.6-3.2&#xB0;C. This will go well beyond the overall target of the Paris Agreement to keep warming &#x201C;well below 2&#xB0;C&#x201D;.</li>
<li><strong>2&#xB0;C consistent</strong>: there are a range of emissions pathways that would be compatible with limiting average warming to 2&#xB0;C by 2100. This would require a significant increase in ambition of the current pledges within the Paris Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>1.5&#xB0;C consistent</strong>: there are a range of emissions pathways that would be compatible with limiting average warming to 1.5&#xB0;C by 2100. However, all would require a very urgent and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.<br>

As a result, we see in the visualization below that there is a strong correlation between per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and GDP per capita.</p><p>This correlation is also present over time: Countries begin in the bottom-left of the chart at low CO<sub>2</sub> and low GDP,&#xA0;and move upwards and to the right. Historically, where fossil fuels are the dominant form of energy, we therefore see increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as an unintended consequence of development and economic prosperity.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co2-emissions-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita-ppp-international-?time=2016" class="grapherPreview">

In the chart below we see the change in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e. the growth rates) over the last few decades (1998-2013) across the global spectrum of emitters.</p><p>On the x-axis we have the spectrum of global emitters (where those at the far left have very low per capita emissions, and those at the far right have the world&#x2019;s highest per capita emissions). On the y-axis we have the growth (in %) in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that each segment of emitters has undergone from 1998-2013. We see that the middle of the spectrum&#x2014;typically those near the middle of the global income spectrum&#x2014;have experienced a large growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the last few decades (most between 25-40%). Insofar as emissions are a correlate of development, this is good news and reflects the fact that a <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-economic-inequality">global middle class is developing</a>, but it does present important challenges in terms of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>It is therefore concerning that at the bottom of the spectrum (the group of people of whom many are part of the world&#x2019;s poorer population) have seen a 12% <em>decline</em> in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over this same period. While a decline in emissions is necessary and possible for individuals with high per capita emissions, for the poorest, this potentially suggests stagnation or decline in living conditions.</p><h6>Growth rate in CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions (from 1998-2013) across the spectrum of global&#xA0;emitters<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

In fact, as the global inequalities in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between countries begin to converge, within-country inequalities become more important. As the chart below shows, in 1998 two-thirds of inequality in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were due to between-country differences.

In our&#xA0;historical and current energy system (which has been primarily built on fossil fuels), CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been an almost unavoidable consequence of the energy access necessary for development and poverty alleviation.</p><p>In the two charts below, we see per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and energy use per capita (both on the y-axes), plotted&#xA0;against the share of the population living in extreme poverty (%) on the x-axis. In general, we see a very similar correlation in both CO<sub>2</sub> and energy: higher emissions and energy access are correlated to lower levels of extreme poverty. Energy access is therefore an essential component in improved living standards and poverty alleviation.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>In an ideal world, this energy could be provided through 100% renewable energy: in such a world, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could be an avoidable consequence of development. However, currently we would expect that some of this energy access will have to come from fossil fuel consumption (although potentially with a higher mix of renewables than older industrial economies). Therefore, although the global challenge is to reduce emissions, some growth in per capita emissions from the world&#x2019;s poorest countries remains a sign of progress in terms of changing living conditions and poverty alleviation.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/energy-use-per-capita-vs-share-of-population-in-extreme-poverty" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="co2-intensity-of-economies"><a class="deep-link" href="#co2-intensity-of-economies"></a>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of economies</h2><p>If economic growth is&#xA0;historically linked to growing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, why do countries have differing levels of per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co2-emissions-per-capita-tonnes-per-year?country=FRA+DEU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite having similar</a> GDP per capita levels? These differences are captured by the differences in the <em>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity</em> of economies; CO<sub>2</sub> intensity measures the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit of GDP (kgCO<sub>2</sub> per int-$). There are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two key variables</a> which can affect the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of an economy:</p><ul>
<li>Energy efficiency: the amount of energy needed for one unit of GDP output. This is often related to productivity and technology efficiency, but can also be related to the type of economic activity underpinning output. If a country&#x2019;s economy <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">transitions from manufacturing to service-based output</a>, less energy is needed in production, therefore less energy is used per unit of GDP.</li>
<li>Carbon efficiency: the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit energy (grams of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per kilowatt-hour). This is largely related to a country&#x2019;s energy mix. An economy powered by coal-fired&#xA0;energy will produce higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of energy versus an energy system with a high percentage of renewable energy. As economies increase their share of renewable capacity, efficiency improves and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit energy falls.</li>
</ul><p>In the chart below, we see that the global CO<sub>2</sub> intensity has been steadily falling since 1990.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>&#xA0;This is likely <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032" target="_blank">thanks to</a> both improved energy and technology efficiency, and increases in the capacity of renewables.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p> The carbon intensity of nearly all national economies has also fallen in recent decades. Today, we see the highest intensities in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South Africa. This is likely to be a compounded effect of coal-dominated energy systems and heavily industrialized economies. The shift in&#xA0;industrial production from high-income to transitioning economies, and its impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, is discussed in the next section.</p><p>Although carbon intensities have generally shown a steady, gradual decline in recent decades, dramatic short-term fluctuations in intensity can occur&#xA0;and are typically the result of significant short-term political or economic change. The most dramatic example of this was seen in China during its &#x2018;Great Leap Forward&#x2019; campaign in the 1950s-60s, which we have explored in detail on our blog <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/chinese-turbulence-how-periods-of-political-reform-affect-the-carbon-intensity-of-economies/">here</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/co2-intensity-of-economies-kgco2-per-unit-gdp" class="grapherPreview">

On average, we see low carbon intensities at low incomes; carbon intensity rises as countries transition from low-to-middle incomes, especially in rapidly growing industrial economies; and as countries move towards higher incomes, carbon intensity falls again.</p><p>This trend is approximately true as a cross-section across countries. However, such trends differ for individual countries over time. If we view these trends over the timeline from 1990 onwards we see that there are large variations in the evolution of carbon intensities, even for countries with similar income levels.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/carbon-emission-intensity-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="the-cost-of-global-co2-mitigation"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-cost-of-global-co2-mitigation"></a>The cost&#xA0;of global CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation</h2><p>With an understanding of the link between CO<sub>2</sub> and global temperatures, as well as knowledge of the sources of emissions, an obvious question arises: How much could we reduce our emissions by, and how much would it cost? The possible cost-benefit of taking global and regional action on climate change is often a major influencing factor on the effectiveness of mitigation agreements and measures. How we work out the potential costs of global climate change mitigation has been covered in an explainer post <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate-climate-change/">here</a>.<br><br></p></section>

<section><h2 id="how-do-we-measure-co2-emissions"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-measure-co2-emissions"></a>How do we measure CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</h2><h3 id="how-do-we-reconstruct-long-term-co2-concentrations"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-reconstruct-long-term-co2-concentrations"></a>How do we reconstruct long-term CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations?</h3><p>In more recent years, global concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured directly in the atmosphere using&#xA0;instrumentation sensor technology. The longest and most well-known records from direct CO<sub>2</sub> measurement comes from the <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO)</a> in Hawaii. The MLO has been measuring atmospheric composition since the 1950s, providing the clearest record of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across the 20th and 21st century.</p><p>To reconstruct long-term CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, we have to rely on a number of geological&#xA0;and chemical analogues which record changes in atmospheric composition through time.&#xA0;The process of ice-coring allows for the longest extension of historical CO<sub>2</sub> records, extending back 800,000 years.&#xA0;The most famous ice core used for historical reconstructions is the <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/vostok.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vostok Ice Core</a> in Antarctica. This core extends back 420,000 years and covers four glacial-interglacial periods.</p><p>Ice cores provide a preserved record of atmospheric compositions&#x2014;with each layer representing a date further back in time. These can extend as deep at 3km. Ice cores preserve tiny bubbles of air which provide a snapshot of the atmospheric composition of a given period. Using chemical dating techniques (such as isotopic dating) researchers relate time periods to depths through an ice core. If <a href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-cores/ice-core-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking at</a> the Vostok Ice Core, researchers can say that the section of core 500m deep was formed approximately 30,000 years ago. CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;concentration sensors can then be used to measure the concentration in air bubbles at 500m depth&#x2014;this was approximately 190 parts per million. Combining these two methods, researchers estimate that 30,000 years ago, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was 190ppm.&#xA0;Repeating this process across a range of depths, the change through time in these concentrations can be reconstructed.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-measure-or-estimate-co2-emissions"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-measure-or-estimate-co2-emissions"></a>How do we measure or estimate&#xA0;CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions?</h3><p>Historical fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reconstructed back to 1751 based on energy statistics. These reconstructions&#xA0;detail the production quantities of various forms of fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, peat and crude oil), which when combined with trade data on imports and exports, allow for national-level reconstructions of fossil fuel production and resultant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. More recent energy statistics are sourced from the UN Statistical Office, which compiles data from official national statistical publications and annual questionnaires. Data on cement production and gas flaring can also be sourced from UN data, supplemented by data from the US Department of Interior Geological Survey (USGS) and US Department of Energy Information Administration.&#xA0;A full description of data acquisition and original sources can be found at the <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/overview_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)</a>.</p><p>As an example: how do we estimate Canada&#x2019;s CO<sub>2&#xA0;</sub>emissions in 1900? Let&#x2019;s look at the steps involved in this estimation.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: we gather&#xA0;industrial data on how much coal, brown coal, peat and crude oil Canada extracted in 1900. This tells us how much energy it could produce if it used all of this domestically.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:&#xA0;</strong>we cannot assume that Canada only used fuels produced domestically&#x2014;it might have imported some fuel, or exported it elsewhere. To find out how much Canada&#xA0;<em>actually</em> burned domestically, we therefore have to correct for this trade. If we take its domestic production (account for any fuel it stores as stocks), add any fuel it imported, and subtract any fuel it exported, we have an estimate of its net consumption in 1900. In other words,&#xA0;if we calculate: Coal extraction &#x2212; Coal exported + Coal imported &#x2212; Coal stored as stocks, we can estimate the amount of coal Canada burned in 1900.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:&#xA0;</strong>converting energy produced to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&#xA0;we know, based on the quality of coal, its carbon content and how much CO<sub>2</sub> would be emitted for every kilogram burned (i.e. its emission factor). Multiplying the quantity of coal burned by its emission factor, we can estimate Canada&#x2019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal in 1900.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> doing this calculation for all fuel types, we can calculate Canada&#x2019;s&#xA0;total emissions in 1900.</li>
</ul><p>Providing good estimates of &#xA0;CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions requires reliable and extensive coverage on domestic and traded energy&#x2014;the international framework and monitoring of this reporting has significantly improved through time. For this reason, our understanding of emissions in the late 20th and 21st centuries is more reliable than our long-term reconstructions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provide clear guidelines on methodologies and best practice for measuring and monitoring CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;estimates at the national level.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p><p>There are two key ways uncertainties can be introduced: the reporting of energy consumption, and the assumption of emissions factors (i.e. the carbon content) used for fuel burning. Since energy consumption is strongly related to economic and trade figures (which are typically monitored closely), uncertainties are typically low for energy reporting. Uncertainty can be introduced in the assumptions nations make on the correct CO<sub>2</sub> emission factor for certain fuel types.</p><p>Country size&#xA0;and the level of uncertainty in these calculations have a significant influence on the inaccuracy of our global emissions figures. In the most extreme example to date, Lui et al. (2015) revealed that China overestimated its annual emissions in 2013 by using global average emission factors, rather than specific figures for&#xA0;the&#xA0;carbon content of its domestic coal supply.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p><p> As the world&#x2019;s largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter, this inaccuracy had a significant impact on global emissions estimates, resulting in a 10% overestimation. More typically, uncertainty in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ranges between 2-5%.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></section>
