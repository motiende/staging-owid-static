A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. The percentage of qualified teachers should not exceed 100%. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations. High values indicate that students are being taught by teachers who are academically well qualified in the subjects they teach.","createdAt":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","code":"UIS.QUTP.1","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"sourceId":5412,"shortUnit":"%","display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5412,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5412,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"18":{"name":"Andorra","code":"AND"},"27":{"name":"Bahrain","code":"BHR"},"29":{"name":"Barbados","code":"BRB"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"36":{"name":"Botswana","code":"BWA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"45":{"name":"Cape Verde","code":"CPV"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"78":{"name":"Swaziland","code":"SWZ"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"93":{"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PRI"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"110":{"name":"Morocco","code":"MAR"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"132":{"name":"Jamaica","code":"JAM"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"144":{"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HKG"},"147":{"name":"Guinea","code":"GIN"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"154":{"name":"Djibouti","code":"DJI"},"157":{"name":"Eritrea","code":"ERI"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"164":{"name":"Cuba","code":"CUB"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"169":{"name":"Comoros","code":"COM"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"194":{"name":"Bermuda","code":"BMU"},"195":{"name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SLB"},"197":{"name":"Cayman Islands","code":"CYM"},"200":{"name":"Dominica","code":"DMA"},"204":{"name":"Kiribati","code":"KIR"},"206":{"name":"Grenada","code":"GRD"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"211":{"name":"Maldives","code":"MDV"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"218":{"name":"Nauru","code":"NRU"},"221":{"name":"Vanuatu","code":"VUT"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"227":{"name":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","code":"KNA"},"230":{"name":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","code":"VCT"},"233":{"name":"Seychelles","code":"SYC"},"234":{"name":"Suriname","code":"SUR"},"235":{"name":"Tonga","code":"TON"},"236":{"name":"Turks and Caicos Islands","code":"TCA"},"262":{"name":"Macao","code":"MAC"},"281":{"name":"Sint Maarten (Dutch part)","code":"SXM"}}}
