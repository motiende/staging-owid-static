A positive value here denotes a country or region is a net importer of CO₂ emissions; a negative value indicates a country is a net exporter.\n\nData is sourced from the Global Carbon Budget (2018): https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/18/data.htm. This presents territorial emissions data in addition to consumption-based and emissions transfers. Consumption-based and emissions transfer estimates are produced by the updated paper by Peters et al. (2011).\n\nData has been converted from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide by Our World in Data using a conversion factor of 3.664. Figures were also multiplied by -1 such that net exports are shown as a negative value; and net imports as a positive value.\n\nThis data has also been calculated by Our World in Data as a share of territorial emissions. This was calculated by dividing emissions transfers (emissions embedded in trade) by a country or region's territorial emissions. \n\nFull reference of the updated paper: Peters, GP, Minx, JC, Weber, CL and Edenhofer, O 2011.
