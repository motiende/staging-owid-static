For detailed information on definitions and coverage, see footnotes.\nGeneral comments: Harmonized series\nStatistical concept and methodology: There are wide variations in definitions and methodology of data collection. In addition to employment in the informal economy, informal employment within the formal sector should be also taken into account. Casual, short term, and seasonal workers, for example, could be informally employed — lacking social protection, health benefits, legal status, rights and freedom of association.
