All data represents average per capita figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nData was calculated either based on:\n(1) sources which originally reported data on a per capita basis, or;\n(2) by dividing sources in total absolute terms by UN Population Division estimates of total population. Where figures were based on dividing by population figures, UN estimates were derived from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017).
