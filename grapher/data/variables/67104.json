forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Access to remote \nsensing imagery has improved in recent years, but remote sensing techniques have limitations. In \nparticular there are limitations to assess land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and \nsome slow changes such as forest regrowth cannot easily be observed with remote sensing techniques \nand require long time periods in order to detect. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density \n(e.g. 10-30%) are difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nData are available for all 234 countries and territories included in FRA 2015. \n \nTime series: \n \n1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
