Mean per capita real consumption or income is measured at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet). For some countries means are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential data. The annualized growth rate is computed as (Mean in final year/Mean in initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The reference year is the year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year in which data were collected is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest survey collected 5 years before the most recent survey available, only surveys collected between 3 and 7 years before the most recent survey are considered. The final year refers to the most recent survey available between 2011 and 2015.\n\nGrowth rates for Iraq are based on survey means of 2005 PPP$.

If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern for a country, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year(s). Annualized growth rates are calculated between the survey years, using a compound growth formula. The survey years defining the period for which growth rates are calculated and the type of welfare aggregate used to calculate the growth rates are noted in the footnotes.\nRelated source links: World Bank, PovcalNet: an online poverty analysis tool, http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"33":{"name":"Bhutan","code":"BTN"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"91":{"name":"Rwanda","code":"RWA"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"114":{"name":"Mauritania","code":"MRT"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"152":{"name":"Georgia","code":"GEO"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZE"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"202":{"name":"Fiji","code":"FJI"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"212":{"name":"Malta","code":"MLT"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"},"379":{"name":"Kosovo","code":"OWID_KOS"}}}
