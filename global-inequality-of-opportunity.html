                Living conditions are vastly unequal between different places in
                our world today. And they have also changed over time: in some
                places living conditions changed dramatically, in others more
                slowly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our individual stories play out amidst these major global
                changes and inequalities and it is these circumstances that
                largely determine how healthy, wealthy, and educated each of us
                will be in our own lives.<a

                Yes, our own hard work and life choices matter. But as we will
                see in the data, these matter much less than the one big thing
                over which we have no control: where and when we are
                born.&#xA0;<span style="font-weight: 400;"

                Today&#x2019;s global inequality is the consequence of two
                centuries of unequal progress. Some places have seen dramatic
                improvements, while others have not. It is on us today to even
                the odds and give everyone &#x2013; no matter where they are
                born &#x2013; the chance of a good life. This is not only right,
                but, as we will see below, is also realistic. Our hope for
                giving the next generations the chance to live a good life lies
                in broad development that makes possible for everyone what is
                only attainable for few today.

                It strikes many people as inherently unfair that some people are
                able to enjoy healthy, wealthy, happy lives whilst others
                continue to live in ill-health, poverty and sorrow. For them it
                is the inequality in the outcomes of people&#x2019;s lives that
                matters. For others it is the inequality in opportunity &#x2013;
                the opportunity to achieve good outcomes &#x2013; that is
                unfair. But the point of this text is to say that these two
                aspects of inequality are not separable. Tony Atkinson said it
                very clearly:
                <em
                  >&#x201C;Inequality of outcome among today&#x2019;s generation
                  is the source of the unfair advantage received by the next
                  generation. If we are concerned about equality of opportunity
                  tomorrow, we need to be concerned about inequality of outcome
                  today.&#x201D;</em

                Today&#x2019;s global inequality of opportunity means that what
                matters most for your living conditions is the good or bad luck
                of your place of birth.

                The inequality between countries that I am focusing on in this
                text is not the only aspect that needs to be considered.
                Inequalities within countries and societies &#x2013; regional
                differences, racial differences, gender differences, and
                inequalities across other dimensions &#x2013; can also be large,
                and are all beyond any individual&#x2019;s own control and
                unfair in the same way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The visualization below shows the inequality in living
                conditions between the worst and best-off countries in the world
                today in a number of aspects:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Health:</strong> A child born in one of the countries
                  with the worst health is 60-times more likely to die than a
                  child born in a country with the best health. In several
                  African countries more than one out of ten children born today
                  will die before they are five years old. In the healthiest
                  countries of the world &#x2013; in Europe and East Asia
                  &#x2013; only 1 in 250 children will die before he or she is 5
                  years old.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Education:</strong> In the countries where people have
                  the best access to education &#x2013; in Europe and North
                  America &#x2013; children of school entrance age today can
                  expect 15 to 20 years of formal education. In Australia, which
                  <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/69706"
                    >is an outlier</a
                  >, school life expectancy is 22.9 years. Children entering
                  school at the same time in countries with the poorest access
                  to education can only expect 5 years. And additionally,
                  children tend to learn much less in schools in poorer
                  countries, as we

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Income:</strong> If you look at average incomes and
                  compare the richest country &#x2013; Qatar with a GDP per
                  capita of almost $117,000 &#x2013; to the poorest country in
                  the world &#x2013; the Central African Republic at $661
                  &#x2013; then you find a 177-fold difference. This is taking
                  into account price differences between countries and therefore
                  expressed in international-$ (<a
                    href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/what-are-ppps"
                    >here</a
                  >
                  is an explanation). Qatar and other very resource-rich
                  economies might be considered outliers here, suggesting that
                  it is more appropriate to compare countries that are very rich
                  without relying mostly on exports of natural resources. The US
                  has a GDP per capita of int.-$54,225 and Switzerland of 57,410
                  international-$. This means the Swiss can spend in 1 month
                  what people in the Central African Republic can spend in 7
                  years.

              <p>
                The inequality between different places in the world is much
                larger than the difference you can make on your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are born in a poor place where every tenth child dies
                you will not be able to get the odds of your baby dying down to
                the average level of countries with the best child health.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a place where the average child can only expect 5 years of
                education it will be immensely harder for a child to obtain the
                level of education even the <em>average</em> child gets in the
                best-off places.
              </p>
              <p>
                The difference is even starker for incomes. In a place where GDP
                per capita is less than $1,000 and the majority lives in
                <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty"
                  >extreme poverty</a
                >, the average incomes in a rich country are unattainable. In a
                text I am publishing soon I will be looking at the research that
                studies how much the place of birth matters for people&#x2019;s
                material prosperity: The short answer is that where you live
                isn&#x2019;t just more important than all your other
                characteristics, it&#x2019;s more important than everything else
                <em>put together</em>.<a

                What is true for inequality across countries around the world
                today, is also true for change over time. What gives people the
                chance for a good life is when the entire society and economy
                around them changes for the better. This is what development and
                economic growth are about: transforming a place so that what was
                previously only attainable for the luckiest few comes into reach
                for most.

                The blue line in the visualization below shows this
                transformation of Finland, a country where people today are

                years of their lives. And the average income in Finland was
                extremely low: GDP per capita was only $827 per year (this is
                adjusted for price increases to keep the purchasing power
                comparable to today). And similarly, even basic education

                a similarly high share of children died before they had their
                fifth birthday. At that time there was little global inequality;
                life was

                And just as there was little inequality in mortality and health
                between different places around the world, there was also little
                inequality within countries. The health of the entire society
                was bad. We have data on the mortality of the English
                aristocracy from 1550 onwards. Aristocrats died just as early as
                everyone else.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"

                >
                Their life expectancy was below 40 years too. Before broader
                social development even the most privileged status within
                society would not give you the chance for a healthy life. You
                just cannot be healthy in an unhealthy place.

                After two centuries of slow, but persistent transformation,
                Finland is today one of the healthiest and wealthiest places in
                the world. It wasn&#x2019;t smooth progress &#x2013; during the
                <a

                >
                in the 1860s the mortality rate increased to over half &#x2013;
                but gradually child health improved and today the child
                mortality rate is 0.23%. Within two centuries, the chances of a
                Finnish child surviving to the first five years of its life
                increased from 58% to 99.77%.
              </p>

                The same is true for income. Back in 1800, global inequality
                between countries was much lower than it is today. Even in those
                countries that are today the richest in the world the
                <a

                >
                until recently. Finland was no exception.
              </p>
              <p>
                The red bubbles in the same chart show child mortality and
                incomes around the world today. It is the same data that we
                discussed above in the discussion on the extent of global
                inequality today, but now you see the data for all the
                world&#x2019;s countries, not just the worst- and best-off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until around 1800, today&#x2019;s best-off places were as poor
                as today&#x2019;s worst-off places, and child mortality was even
                worse. All were in the top-left corner of the chart. What
                created the global inequality we see today were the large
                cross-country differences in improvements in health and economic
                growth over the last two centuries. Angus Deaton referred to
                this as the &#x2018;Great Escape&#x2019;. He wrote
                <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10054.html"
                  >a book</a
                >
                about it with this title in which he chronicles how some parts
                of the world escaped the worst poverty and disease, while others
                lagged behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without looking at the data it is not possible to understand
                just how dramatically the prosperity and health of a society can
                be transformed. The health and prosperity in the past was so
                very bad that no one in Finland could have imagined living the
                life that is today the reality for the average person in
                Finland.

                Even the countries where health and access to education are
                worst today have made progress in these dimensions. In the chart
                on global inequality I added the estimates for the global
                average for each dimension two centuries ago underneath each
                scale. In terms of health, even today&#x2019;s worst off places
                are faring better than the best-off places in the past.

                And just as there is
                <a href="http://bit.ly/2KrfHjx">almost no overlap</a> between
                the distributions of income in today&#x2019;s poor and rich
                countries, there is also almost no overlap between the
                distribution of income in a rich country today and that of the
                same country in the past.

                The fact that these transformations improved the living
                conditions of entire societies so dramatically, means that
                it&#x2019;s not just <em>where</em> you are born that matters
                for your living conditions, but also the time <em>when</em> you
                were born. Children with a good chance of survival are not just
                born in the right place, but also at the right time. In a world
                of improving health and economic growth, all of us born in the
                recent past have had much better chances of good health and
                prosperity than all who came before us.

                The global inequality of opportunity in today&#x2019;s world is
                the consequence of global inequality in health, wealth,
                education and the

                Your living conditions are much more determined by what is
                outside your control &#x2013; the place and time that you are
                born into &#x2013; than by your own effort, dedication, and the
                choices you have made in life.

              <p>
                The fact that it is the randomness of where a child is born that
                determines his or her chances of surviving, getting an
                education, or living free of poverty cannot be accepted. We have
                to end this unfairness so that children with the best living
                conditions are just as likely to be born in Sub-Saharan Africa
                as in Europe or North America.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know that this is possible. This is what the historical
                perspective makes clear. Today Finland is in the bottom right
                corner of the chart above: one of the healthiest and richest
                places on the planet. Two centuries ago Finland was all the way
                in the top left: as poor a place as today&#x2019;s poorest
                countries and with a child mortality rate much worse than any
                place in the world today.
              </p>
              <p>
                The inequality that we see in the world today is the consequence
                of unequal progress. Our generation has the opportunity &#x2013;
                and responsibility I believe &#x2013; to allow every part of the
                world to develop and transform into a place where health, access
                to education, and prosperity is a reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is no reason to believe that what was possible for Finland
                &#x2013; and all other countries in the bottom right which today
                are much healthier and wealthier than they were two centuries
                ago &#x2013; should not be possible for the rest of the world.
                Indeed, as shown by the massive reduction in global child
                mortality between 1800 and 2017 &#x2013; from a global average
                of 43% to 3.9%, as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines
                &#x2013; much of the world is well on its way.
