Today, there are four oral rotavirus vaccines recommended for use by the World Health Organisation (WHO): Rotarix, RotaTeq, RotaSiil, and Rotavac.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> Rotarix and RotaTeq are the most widely used and both have shown good efficacy against rotavirus infections in clinical trials.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Since the use of rotavirus vaccines have been approved, they have had a notable impact on the reduction of rotavirus-related deaths. According to a study published in 2018, the use of rotavirus vaccines prevented approximately 28,900 child deaths globally in 2016. However, as the chart below shows, full vaccine use &#x2013; that is a 100% coverage globally &#x2013; could have prevented an additional 83,200 deaths.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> This means that, even at the current rates of efficacy, 53% of all deaths in children under-5 from rotavirus in 2016 could have been avoided by full vaccine coverage.</p><p>In addition to saving lives, the rotavirus vaccine also reduces the burden on healthcare systems. Between 2008 and 2016 the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine has reduced the number of diarrhea-related hospital admissions on average by 40%.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/avertable-deaths-from-rotavirus-with-full-vaccine-coverage" class="grapherPreview">

</table></div><p>The reasons for different responses to the vaccine are not entirely clear.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is likely that the gut responses to the oral rotavirus vaccines in children in lower-income countries are different. This may be due to a variety of causes, including <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/micronutrient-deficiency">micronutrient deficiencies</a>, pre-vaccination exposure to certain pathogens, and the presence of chronic conditions such as <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/malaria">malaria</a> or <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hiv-aids">HIV</a>. Overall, the poor gut response to the live vaccine means the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced. Taking all of the above mentioned points into account, there are several interventions that could increase the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine even further. In addition to increasing the vaccine coverage, improving nutritional health (of both infants and mothers) and improving hygiene and sanitation conditions (to lower the prevalence of damaging pathogens) could have positive effects on the vaccine&#x2019;s efficacy.</p><p>We are still at quite an early stage of the rotavirus vaccine use. Although the vaccine has brought huge benefits already, it could go even further. Improving vaccination coverage, particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is key to continued reduction of childhood deaths from diarrhea. Even at moderate levels of vaccine efficacy, a significant number of additional additional child deaths could be prevented every year. The bar chart above that shows the number of preventable deaths illustrates the potential for extended vaccine coverage to save many more lives. And this is already taking into account the regional differences in the vaccine&#x2019;s effectiveness.</p><p>In addition to increased coverage, improving the effectiveness of the vaccine would go even further in tackling one of the leading causes of death.</p><h3 id="other-high-impact-interventions"><a class="deep-link" href="#other-high-impact-interventions"></a>Other high-impact interventions</h3><p>While rotavirus is the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/childhood-diarrheal-diseases#what-causes-diarrheal-diseases">leading cause of diarrhea in children</a> and therefore, rotavirus vaccine can save the lives of many children, it is not the only cause of diarrhea. To prevent deaths from other diarrheal diarrheal pathogens we need additional interventions and treatments.</p><p>Deaths from other diarrheal pathogens, such as cholera or shigella, could be avoided by <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/childhood-diarrheal-diseases#how-can-we-stop-child-deaths-from-diarrhea">antibiotics or vaccines</a>, where they are available. But preventions that limit the risks of exposure to diarrheal pathogens in the first place are the key to saving the most lives. <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/water-use-sanitation">Unsafe water and unsafe sanitation</a> contributed to 72% and 56% of the under-5 deaths from diarrheal diseases in 2016. Children who are <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hunger-and-undernourishment">undernourished</a>, are less likely to survive a diarrheal episode. Consequently, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-weight-for-height-wasting">childhood wasting</a> (having a weight too low for their height) is the leading risk factor for diarrheal mortality in children, contributing to an estimated 80% of under-5 deaths from diarrheal diseases in 2016.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> Clearly, eliminating <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/childhood-diarrheal-diseases#why-are-children-still-dying-from-diarrhea">risk factors</a> associated with diarrheal diseases should be on our priority list.</p><p>One of the most cost-effective ways to treat most cases of diarrhea, including those due to rotavirus infection, is not a highly sophisticated drug or vaccine but a simple water, salt and sugar solution: oral rehydration therapy (ORT). ORT can be used to prevent deaths from diarrhea originating from any cause, and has already saved the lives of tens of millions of children since its introduction in the 1970s. We will cover the successes and potential of ORT in an upcoming post.</p></section>
