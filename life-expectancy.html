population &#x2013; is one of the key measures of a population&#x2019;s health.</p><p>Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy#life-expectancy-has-improved-globally">was around 30 years</a> in all regions of the world. </p><p>Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Age of Enlightenment. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800. Many countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly. </p><p>Since 1900 the global average life expectancy has more than doubled and is now above 70 years. The inequality of life expectancy is still very large across and within countries.&#xA0;in 2019 the country with the lowest life expectancy is the Central African Republic with 53 years, in Japan life expectancy is 30 years longer.</p></section>



<section><h2 id="changes-in-life-expectancy"><a class="deep-link" href="#changes-in-life-expectancy"></a>Changes in life expectancy</h2><h4 id="twice-as-long-life-expectancy-around-the-world"><a class="deep-link" href="#twice-as-long-life-expectancy-around-the-world"></a>Twice as long &#x2013; life expectancy around the world</h4><p>The three maps below show the global history of life expectancy over the last two centuries.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Demographic research suggests that at the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century no country in the world had a life expectancy over 40 years.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Every country is shown in red. Almost everyone in the world <a href="https://owid.cloud/extreme-poverty">lived in extreme poverty</a>, we had very little medical knowledge or understanding of disease burden, and in all countries our ancestors had to prepare for an early death.</p><p>Over the next 150 years <em>some</em> parts of the world achieved substantial health improvements. A global divide opened. In 1950&#xA0;the life expectancy for newborns was already over 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan and parts of South America. But elsewhere a newborn could only expect to live around 30 years. The global inequality in health was enormous in 1950: People in Norway had a life expectancy of 72 years, whilst in Mali this was 26 years. Africa as a whole had a life expectancy of only 36 years. People in other world regions could expect to live more than twice as long.</p><p>The decline of <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality">child mortality</a> was important for the increase of life expectancy, but as we explain in our <a href="https://owid.cloud/entries/life-expectancy">entry on life expectancy</a>&#xA0;increasing life expectancy was certainly not only about falling child mortality &#x2013; <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy#it-is-not-only-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-by-age">life expectancy increased at all ages</a>.</p><p>Such improvements in life expectancy&#xA0;&#x2014; despite being exclusive to particular countries&#xA0;&#x2014; was a landmark sign of progress. It was the first time in human history that we achieved improvements in health for entire populations.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> After millennia of stagnation in terrible health conditions the seal was finally broken.</p><p>Now, let&#x2019;s look at the change since 1950. Many of us have not updated our world view. We still <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/">tend to think</a> of the world as divided as it was in 1950. But in health &#x2014; and <a href="https://owid.cloud/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts">many other aspects</a> &#x2014; the world has made rapid progress. Today most people in the world can expect to live as long as those in the very richest countries in 1950. Today&#x2019;s global average life expectancy of 71 years is higher than that of any country in 1950 with the exception of a handful in Northern Europe.</p><p>The visualization summarizes the global history of life expectancy over the last two centuries: Back in 1800 a newborn baby could only expect a short life, no matter where in the world it was born. In 1950 newborns had the chance of a longer life if they were lucky enough to be born in the right place. In recent decades all regions of the world made very substantial progress, and it were those regions that were worst-off in 1950 that achieved the biggest progress since then. The divided world of 1950 has been narrowing.</p><p>Globally the life expectancy increased from less than 30 years to over 70 years; after two centuries of progress we can expect to live more than twice as long as our ancestors. And this progress was not achieved in a few places. In every world region we can now expect to live more than twice as long.</p><p>The global inequalities in health that we see today also show that we can do much better. The almost unbelievable progress the entire world has achieved over the last two centuries should be encouragement enough for us to realize what is possible.</p><h6>Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/10/3-World-maps-of-Life-expectancy-e1538651530288.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/10/3-World-maps-of-Life-expectancy-e1538651530288.png" alt="3 world maps of life expectancy e1538651530288" class="wp-image-20901"></a></figure><h3 id="rising-life-expectancy-around-the-world"><a class="deep-link" href="#rising-life-expectancy-around-the-world"></a>Rising life expectancy around the world</h3><p>The visualization below shows the dramatic increase in life expectancy over the last few centuries as a line chart. For the UK &#x2013; the country for which we have the longest time-series &#x2013; we see that before the 19th century there was no trend for life expectancy: life expectancy fluctuated between 30 and 40 years.</p><p>Over the last 200 years people in all countries in the world achieved impressive progress in health that lead to increases in life expectancy. In the UK, life expectancy doubled and is now higher than 80 years. In Japan health started to improve later, but the country caught up quickly with the UK and surpassed it in the late 1960s. In South Korea health started to improve later still and the country achieved even faster progress than the UK and Japan; by now life expectancy in South Korea has surpassed life expectancy in the UK.</p><p>The chart also shows how low life expectancy was in some countries in the past: A century ago life expectancy in India and&#xA0;South Korea was as low as 23 years. A century later, life expectancy in India has almost tripled and in South Korea it has almost quadrupled.</p><p>You can switch to the map view to compare life expectancy across countries. This view shows that there are still huge differences between countries: people in Sub-Saharan countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, while in Japan it exceeds 80.</p><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/life-expectancy" class="grapherPreview">

But as this chart below shows, there is much more to it.</p><p>Child mortality is defined as the number of children dying before their 5th birthday. To see how life expectancy has improved without taking child mortality into account we therefore have to look at the prospects of a child who just survived their 5th birthday: in 1841 a 5-year old could expect to live 55 years. Today a 5-year old can expect to live 82 years. An increase of 27 years.</p><p>At higher ages mortality patterns have also changed. A 50-year old could once expect to live an additional twenty years. Today the life expectancy of a 50-year old has increased to an additional 33 years.</p><p>And another important change can be studied in this chart: <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/health-inequality/">health inequality</a> decreased very substantially. Look by how much life expectancy differed by age in 1845 &#x2013; from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today this span is much smaller &#x2013; from 81 to 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the equality of life spans across all people has increased.</p><p>The exceptionally high mortality of the 1918 flu epidemic stands out in this visualisation. Life expectancy (the period measure here) drops sharply.<br>Interestingly this epidemic affected few old people, life expectancy at an old age hardly changed. This was the case presumably since older people had some immunity from the previous Russian flu pandemic of 1889&#x2013;90.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><h6>Total life expectancy by age in England and Wales, 1800-2013<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

The below chart provides an example, plotting survival curves for individuals born at different points in time, using cohort life tables from England and Wales.</p><p>At any age level in the horizontal axis, the curves in the chart below mark the estimated proportion of individuals who are expected to survive that age. As we can see, less than half of the people born in 1851 in England and Wales made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, more than 95% of the people born in England and Wales today can expect to live longer than 50 years.</p><p>Since life expectancy estimates only describe averages, these indicators are complementary, and help us understand how health is distributed across time and space.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

<li>The colored symbols represent the highest life expectancy of women from 1840 to today &#x2013; indicating that country with the highest life expectancy at each point in time. For instance, we can see that in the mid-1800s, Norway had the highest life expectancy, but then by 1880 people in non-Maori New Zealand were expected to live the longest lives. The data shows that in the&#xA0; life expectancy in the leading country of the world has increased by three months every single year.</li>
<li>The solid horizontal line represents the results of the linear regression on all these points; remarkably, the maximum life expectancy seems to follow this linear trend very closely. The gray dashed line is the extension of this trend into the future, and the red dashed lines represent &#x2018;projections of female life expectancy in Japan published by the UN in 1986, 1999, and 2001.&#x2019;</li>
<li>The author names listed on the right refer to multiple predictions of the maximum possible life expectancy for humans. The horizontal black lines extending from the publication denote the prediction in each publication of the asserted ceiling on life expectancy attainable by humans <em>and</em> the year in which the study was published. Dublin published a study in 1928 that asserted that the maximum life expectancy possible was less than 65 while at the same time life expectancy in New Zealand was already over 65. The predictions of maximum life expectancy were proven wrong again and again over the course of the last century. On average the predictions have been broken within 5 years after publication.</li>

Mortality in England began to decline in the wake of the Enlightenment, directly through the application to health of new ideas about personal health and public administration, and indirectly through increased productivity that permitted (albeit with some terrible reversals) better levels of living, better nutrition, better housing and better sanitation. Ideas about the germ theory of disease were critical to changing both public health infrastructure and personal behavior. Similarly, knowledge about the health effects of smoking in the middle of the twentieth century has had profound effects on behavior and on health. Most recently, the major life-saving scientific innovations in medical procedures and new pharmaceuticals have had a major effect, particularly on reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease. There have also been important health innovations whose effect has been mainly in poor countries: for example, the development of freeze-dried serums that can be transported without refrigeration, and of oral rehydration therapy for preventing the death of children from diarrhea.&#x201D;</em></p><h3 id="life-expectancy-and-gdp"><a class="deep-link" href="#life-expectancy-and-gdp"></a>Life expectancy and GDP</h3><p>This graph displays the correlation between life expectancy and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In general, countries with higher GDP have a higher life expectancy. The relationship seems to follow a logarithmic trend: the unit increase in life expectancy per unit increase in GDP decreases as GDP per capita increases.</p><p>The cross-sectional relationship between life expectancy and per capita income is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_curve">Preston Curve</a>, named after Samuel H. Preston who first described it in 1975. In the chart I plot the cross-sectional relationship for the years 1800, 1950, 1980, and 2012. Interestingly we then find that the&#xA0;life expectancy associated with a given level of real income is rising over time. If economic development were the only determinant of health countries that get richer would just move along the same curve. Since this is not the case we can conclude that economic development cannot be the sole determinant of health. A possible explanation for this changing relationship is that scientific understanding and technological progress makes some very efficient public health interventions &#x2013; such as <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/vaccination/">vaccinations</a>, hygiene measures, oral rehydration therapy, and public health measures &#x2013; cheaper and brings these more and more into the reach of populations with lower incomes.</p><h6>Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita since 1800<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

<section><h2 id="definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#definitions"></a>Definitions</h2><h3 id="life-expectancy-what-does-this-actually-mean"><a class="deep-link" href="#life-expectancy-what-does-this-actually-mean"></a>&#x201C;Life expectancy&#x201D; &#x2013; what does this actually mean?</h3><p>Life expectancy has <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy#twice-as-long-life-expectancy-around-the-world">doubled in all world regions</a>. What does this mean exactly?</p><p>Despite its importance and prominence in research and policy, it is surprisingly difficult to find a simple yet detailed description of what &#x201C;life expectancy&#x201D; actually means. In this section, we try to fill this gap.</p><p>The term &#x201C;life expectancy&#x201D; refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die.</p><p>In practice, however, things are often more complicated:</p><p>One important distinction and clarification is the difference between <em>cohort</em> and <em>period life expectancy.</em> </p><p>The <strong>cohort life expectancy</strong> is the average life length of a particular cohort &#x2013; a group of individuals born in a given year. When we can track a group of people born in a particular year, many decades ago, and observe the exact date in which each one of them died then we can calculate this <em>cohort&#x2019;s</em> life expectancy by simply calculating the average of the ages of all members when they died.</p><p>It is of course not possible to know this metric before all members of the cohort have died. Because of that statisticians commonly track members of a particular cohort and predict the average age-at-death for them using a combination of observed mortality rates for past years and projections about mortality rates for future years.</p><p>An alternative approach consists in estimating the average length of life for a <em>hypothetical</em> cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at one particular <em>period</em> &#x2013; commonly a year. This approach leads to what is known as &#x2018;<strong>period life expectancy</strong>&#x2018; and it is the much more commonly used life expectancy metric. It is the definition used by most international organizations, including the UN and the World Bank, when reporting &#x2018;life expectancy&#x2019; figures. Period life expectancy estimates do not take into account how mortality rates are changing over time and instead only reflects the mortality pattern at one point in time. Because of this, period life expectancy figures are usually different to cohort life expectancy figures.</p><h4 id="an-example-to-illustrate-the-measurement-of-life-expectancy"><a class="deep-link" href="#an-example-to-illustrate-the-measurement-of-life-expectancy"></a><strong>An example to illustrate the measurement of life expectancy</strong></h4><p>Since period life expectancy estimates are ubiquitous in research and public debate, it is helpful to use an example to flesh out the concept. Let&#x2019;s consider the visualization below, which maps life expectancy&#x2014;specifically period life expectancy&#x2014;at birth, country by county in 2005. You can hover the mouse over a country to display the corresponding estimate.</p><p>For Japan, we can see that life expectancy in 2005 was 82.3 years. This means that a hypothetical cohort of infants living through the age-specific mortality of Japan in 2005 could expect to live 82.3 years, under the assumption that mortality patterns observed in 2005 remain constant throughout their lifetime. But if life expectancies are increasing the reality for a cohort born then is that the cohort life expectancy is higher than that period life expectancy. We see this in the data: if you move the slider forward in the chart below, you&#x2019;ll see that in 2019 the period life expectancy in Japan was 84.6 years, which means that mortality patterns in Japan did improve in the period 2005-2019.</p><p>In general, the commonly-used period life expectancies tend to be lower than the cohort life expectancies, because mortality rates were falling over the course of modern development. Whenever mortality rates are falling then the <em>period life expectancy</em> is lower than the life expectancy of the cohort born then</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/life-expectancy?tab=map&amp;year=2005" class="grapherPreview">

Most will die much earlier or much later, since the risk of death is not uniform across the lifetime. Life expectancy is the average.</p><p>In societies with high infant mortality rates many people die in the first few years of life; but once they survive childhood, people often live much longer. Indeed, this is a common source of confusion in the interpretation of life expectancy figures: It is perfectly possible that a given population has a low life expectancy at birth, and yet has a large proportion of old people.</p><h4 id="commonly-we-study-life-expectancy-at-birth-but-life-expectancy-at-higher-ages-are-also-relevant"><a class="deep-link" href="#commonly-we-study-life-expectancy-at-birth-but-life-expectancy-at-higher-ages-are-also-relevant"></a>Commonly we study life expectancy at birth, but life expectancy at higher ages are also relevant</h4><p>Given that life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life, it is common to report life expectancy figures at different ages, both under the period and cohort approaches. For example, the UN estimates that <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/life-expectancy-at-age-10?country=OWID_WRL">the (period) global life expectancy at age 10 in 2005 was 63.6 years</a>. This means that the group of 10-year-old children alive around the world in 2005 could expect to live another 63.6 years (i.e. until the age of 73.6), provided that mortality patterns observed in 2005 remained constant throughout their lifetime.</p><p>Finally, another point to bear in mind is that period and cohort life expectancy estimates are statistical measures, and they do not take into account any person-specific factors such as lifestyle choices. Clearly, the length of life for an average person is not very informative about the predicted length of life for a person living a particularly unhealthy lifestyle.</p><p><strong>How is life expectancy calculated?</strong></p><p>In practical terms, estimating life expectancy entails predicting the probability of surviving successive years of life, based on observed age-specific mortality rates. How is this actually done?</p><p>Age-specific mortality rates are usually estimated by counting (or projecting) the number of age-specific deaths in a time interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 who died in the year 2005), and dividing by the total observed (or projected) population alive at a given point within that interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 alive on 1 July 2015).</p><p>To ensure that the resulting estimates of the probabilities of death within each age interval are smooth across the lifetime, it is common to use mathematical formulas, to model how the force of mortality changes within and across age intervals. Specifically, it is often assumed that the proportion of people dying in an age interval starting in year <svg class="latex" xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="1.33ex" height="1.676ex" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex;" viewBox="0 -576.1 572.5 721.6" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

In these cases, the resulting life expectancy estimates cannot be simply classified into the &#x2018;period&#x2019; or &#x2018;cohort&#x2019; categories.</p><p><strong>What else can we learn from &#x2018;life tables&#x2019;?</strong></p><p>Life tables are not just instrumental to the production of life expectancy figures (as noted above), they also provide many other perspectives on the mortality of a population. For example, they allow for the production of &#x2018;population survival curves&#x2019;, which show the share of people who are expected to survive various successive ages. The below chart provides an example, plotting survival curves for individuals born at different points in time, using cohort life tables from England and Wales.</p><p>At any age level in the horizontal axis, the curves in the chart below mark the estimated proportion of individuals who are expected to survive that age. As we can see, less than half of the people born in 1851 in England and Wales made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, more than 95% of the people born in England and Wales today can expect to live longer than 50 years.</p><p>Since life expectancy estimates only describe averages, these indicators are complementary, and help us understand how health is distributed across time and space. In our entry on <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy/">Life Expectancy</a> you can read more about related complementary indicators, such as the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy/#median-age-by-country">median age of a population.</a></p><div class="wp-block-image">
