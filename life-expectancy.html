class="contentAndFootnotes"><div class="article-content"><section><p>Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Enlightenment. Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. Countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly.&#xA0;Since 1900 the global average life expectancy has more than doubled and is now approaching 70 years. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800.</p></section>

For the UK &#x2013; the country for which we have the longest time-series &#x2013; we see that before the 19th century there was no trend for life expectancy: life expectancy fluctuated between 30 and 40 years.</p><p>Over the last 200 years people in all countries in the world achieved impressive progress in health that lead to increases in life expectancy. In the UK, life expectancy doubled and is now higher than 80 years. In Japan health started to improve later, but the country caught up quickly with the UK and surpassed it in the late 1960s. In South Korea health started to improve later still and the country achieved even faster progress than the UK and Japan; by now life expectancy in South Korea has surpassed life expectancy in the UK.</p><p>The chart also shows how low life expectancy was in some countries in the past: A century ago life expectancy in India and&#xA0;South Korea was as low as 23 years. A century later, life expectancy in India has almost tripled and in South Korea it has almost quadrupled.</p><p>You can switch to the map view to compare life expectancy across countries. This view shows that there are still huge differences between countries: people in Sub-Saharan countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, while in Japan it exceeds 80.</p><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/life-expectancy" class="grapherPreview">

But as this chart below shows, there is much more to it.</p><p>Child mortality is defined as the number of children dying before their 5th birthday. To see how life expectancy has improved without taking child mortality into account we therefore have to look at the prospects of a child who just survived their 5th birthday: in 1841 a 5-year old could expect to live 55 years. Today a 5-year old can expect to live 82 years. An increase of 27 years.</p><p>At higher ages mortality patterns have also changed. A 50-year old could once expect to live an additional twenty years. Today the life expectancy of a 50-year old has increased to an additional 33 years.</p><p>And another important change can be studied in this chart: <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/health-inequality/">health inequality</a> decreased very substantially. Look by how much life expectancy differed by age in 1845 &#x2013; from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today this span is much smaller &#x2013; from 81 to 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the equality of life spans across all people has increased.</p><p>The exceptionally high mortality of the 1918 flu epidemic stands out in this visualisation. Life expectancy (the period measure here) drops sharply.<br>Interestingly this epidemic affected few old people, life expectancy at an old age hardly changed. This was the case presumably since older people had some immunity from the previous Russian flu pandemic of 1889&#x2013;90.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><h6>Total life expectancy by age in England and Wales, 1800-2013<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

</div><h4 id="a-different-view-on-mortality-by-age-survival-curves"><a class="deep-link" href="#a-different-view-on-mortality-by-age-survival-curves"></a>A different view on mortality by age &#x2013; survival curves</h4><p>&#x2018;Population survival curves&#x2019; show the share of people who are expected to survive various successive ages. The below chart provides an example, plotting survival curves for individuals born at different points in time, using cohort life tables from England and Wales.</p><p>At any age level in the horizontal axis, the curves in the chart below mark the estimated proportion of individuals who are expected to survive that age. As we can see, less than half of the people born in 1851 in England and Wales made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, more than 95% of the people born in England and Wales today can expect to live longer than 50 years.</p><p>Since life expectancy estimates only describe averages, these indicators are complementary, and help us understand how health is distributed across time and space.</p><div class="wp-block-image">

Almost everyone in the world <a href="https://owid.cloud/extreme-poverty">lived in extreme poverty</a>, we had very little medical knowledge or understanding of disease burden, and in all countries our ancestors had to prepare for an early death.</p><p>Over the next 150 years <em>some</em> parts of the world achieved substantial health improvements. A global divide opened. In 1950&#xA0;the life expectancy for newborns was already over 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan and parts of South America. But elsewhere a newborn could only expect to live around 30 years. The global inequality in health was enormous in 1950: People in Norway had a life expectancy of 72 years, whilst in Mali this was 26 years. Africa as a whole had a life expectancy of only 36 years. People in other world regions could expect to live more than twice as long.</p><p>The decline of <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality">child mortality</a> was important for the increase of life expectancy, but as we explain in our <a href="https://owid.cloud/entries/life-expectancy">entry on life expectancy</a>&#xA0;increasing life expectancy was certainly not only about falling child mortality &#x2013; <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy#it-is-not-only-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-by-age">life expectancy increased at all ages</a>.</p><p>Such improvements in life expectancy&#xA0;&#x2014; despite being exclusive to particular countries&#xA0;&#x2014; was a landmark sign of progress. It was the first time in human history that we achieved improvements in health for entire populations.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> After millennia of stagnation in terrible health conditions the seal was finally broken.</p><p>Now, let&#x2019;s look at the change since 1950. Many of us have not updated our world view. We still <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/">tend to think</a> of the world as divided as it was in 1950. But in health &#x2014; and <a href="https://owid.cloud/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts">many other aspects</a> &#x2014; the world has made rapid progress. Today most people in the world can expect to live as long as those in the very richest countries in 1950. Today&#x2019;s global average life expectancy of 71 years is higher than that of any country in 1950 with the exception of a handful in Northern Europe.</p><p>The visualization summarizes the global history of life expectancy over the last two centuries: Back in 1800 a newborn baby could only expect a short life, no matter where in the world it was born. In 1950 newborns had the chance of a longer life if they were lucky enough to be born in the right place. In recent decades all regions of the world made very substantial progress, and it were those regions that were worst-off in 1950 that achieved the biggest progress since then. The divided world of 1950 has been narrowing.</p><p>Globally the life expectancy increased from less than 30 years to over 70 years; after two centuries of progress we can expect to live more than twice as long as our ancestors. And this progress was not achieved in a few places. In every world region we can now expect to live more than twice as long.</p><p>The global inequalities in health that we see today also show that we can do much better. The almost unbelievable progress the entire world has achieved over the last two centuries should be encouragement enough for us to realize what is possible.</p><h6>Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-World-maps-of-Life-expectancy-e1538651530288.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-World-maps-of-Life-expectancy-e1538651530288.png" alt="3 world maps of life expectancy e1538651530288" class="wp-image-20901"></a></figure><h3 id="life-expectancy-increased-in-all-countries-of-the-world"><a class="deep-link" href="#life-expectancy-increased-in-all-countries-of-the-world"></a>Life expectancy increased in all countries of the world</h3><p>There is a lot of information in the following &#x2013; rather unusual &#x2013; chart.

<li>The colored symbols represent the highest life expectancy of women from 1840 to today &#x2013; indicating that country with the highest life expectancy at each point in time. For instance, we can see that in the mid-1800s, Norway had the highest life expectancy, but then by 1880 people in non-Maori New Zealand were expected to live the longest lives. The data shows that in the&#xA0; life expectancy in the leading country of the world has increased by three months every single year.</li>
<li>The solid horizontal line represents the results of the linear regression on all these points; remarkably, the maximum life expectancy seems to follow this linear trend very closely. The gray dashed line is the extension of this trend into the future, and the red dashed lines represent &#x2018;projections of female life expectancy in Japan published by the UN in 1986, 1999, and 2001.&#x2019;</li>
<li>The author names listed on the right refer to multiple predictions of the maximum possible life expectancy for humans. The horizontal black lines extending from the publication denote the prediction in each publication of the asserted ceiling on life expectancy attainable by humans <em>and</em> the year in which the study was published. Dublin published a study in 1928 that asserted that the maximum life expectancy possible was less than 65 while at the same time life expectancy in New Zealand was already over 65. The predictions of maximum life expectancy were proven wrong again and again over the course of the last century. On average the predictions have been broken within 5 years after publication.</li>

Mortality in England began to decline in the wake of the Enlightenment, directly through the application to health of new ideas about personal health and public administration, and indirectly through increased productivity that permitted (albeit with some terrible reversals) better levels of living, better nutrition, better housing and better sanitation. Ideas about the germ theory of disease were critical to changing both public health infrastructure and personal behavior. Similarly, knowledge about the health effects of smoking in the middle of the twentieth century has had profound effects on behavior and on health. Most recently, the major life-saving scientific innovations in medical procedures and new pharmaceuticals have had a major effect, particularly on reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease. There have also been important health innovations whose effect has been mainly in poor countries: for example, the development of freeze-dried serums that can be transported without refrigeration, and of oral rehydration therapy for preventing the death of children from diarrhea.&#x201D;</em></p><h3 id="life-expectancy-and-gdp"><a class="deep-link" href="#life-expectancy-and-gdp"></a>Life expectancy and GDP</h3><p>This graph displays the correlation between life expectancy and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In general, countries with higher GDP have a higher life expectancy. The relationship seems to follow a logarithmic trend: the unit increase in life expectancy per unit increase in GDP decreases as GDP per capita increases.</p><p>The cross-sectional relationship between life expectancy and per capita income is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_curve">Preston Curve</a>, named after Samuel H. Preston who first described it in 1975. In the chart I plot the cross-sectional relationship for the years 1800, 1950, 1980, and 2012. Interestingly we then find that the&#xA0;life expectancy associated with a given level of real income is rising over time. If economic development were the only determinant of health countries that get richer would just move along the same curve. Since this is not the case we can conclude that economic development cannot be the sole determinant of health. A possible explanation for this changing relationship is that scientific understanding and technological progress makes some very efficient public health interventions &#x2013; such as <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/vaccination/">vaccinations</a>, hygiene measures, oral rehydration therapy, and public health measures &#x2013; cheaper and brings these more and more into the reach of populations with lower incomes.</p><h6>Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita since 1800<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

The data for life expectancy by age is taken from the Human Mortality Database. University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). Available at <a href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</a> (data downloaded on 15 April 2017). The data on life expectancy at birth before 1845 is taken from Clio-Infra.</p></li><li id="note-3"><p> <br>James C.

Population and Development Review. Volume 31, Issue 3, pages 537–543, September 2005.<br> For this project life expectancy estimates have been drawn from some 700 sources. The estimates along with the sources are presented online at <a href="http://www.lifetable.de/">lifetable.de</a>. Notes:<br> a) The global average is weighted by the population sizes and relies on Angus Maddison&#8217;s population estimates.<br> b) There is too little information available to estimate Oceania&#8217;s population in 1800 or 1820.<br> c) A life expectancy of 22.5 years refers to the indigenous population. For the Europeans he estimates a life expectancy of 45.6 years.<br> </p></li><li id="note-4"><p>To make comparisons possible they all use the same legend and the researchers that reconstructed the historical data have applied today&#8217;s country borders when reporting the health of the past populations around the world.</p></li><li id="note-5"><p>The country-by-country estimates for 1800 come with a considerable uncertainty and to not give a false sense of certainty I have not added these estimates into the map, but the estimates for life expectancies are considerably lower than 40 years – as is also shown for the regional and global estimates so that it is safe to assume that showing a life expectancy of less than 40 years on the map is correct. The few European countries with a life expectancy close to 40 years have more accurate data for this time period so that it seems unlikely that the life expectancy there was over 40 years, or at best it was only barely over 40 years.</p></li><li id="note-6"><p>For a discussion of pre-health transition estimates of life expectancy see&nbsp;James Riley (2005) – Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy, 1800–2001.
