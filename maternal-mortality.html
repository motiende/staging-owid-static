<section><h2 id="maternal-mortality-today"><a class="deep-link" href="#maternal-mortality-today"></a>Maternal mortality today</h2><p>For most of our history, pregnancy and childbirth were dangerous for both baby and mother. If we look at <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/maternal-mortality#how-have-maternal-mortality-changed-over-the-long-term">long-term trends</a> in maternal mortality &#x2013; the likelihood a woman will die from pregnancy-related causes &#x2013; we see that every 100th to 200th birth led to the mother&#x2019;s death.</p><p>Improvements in <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/maternal-mortality#what-share-of-births-are-attended-by-health-staff">healthcare</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/micronutrient-deficiency#anemia-in-pregnant-women">nutrition</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/water-use-sanitation">hygiene</a> mean maternal deaths are <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/maternal-mortality#decline-of-maternal-mortality-across-the-world">much rarer</a> today. But women are still dying from pregnancy-related causes that <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality">are preventable</a>.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300,000 women died from pregnancy-related causes in 2015. That&#x2019;s 830 women every day.</p><p>In the chart below we see global maternal deaths by region. Two-thirds &#x2013; 201,000 &#x2013; occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. 22% &#x2013; 66,000 &#x2013; occurred in South Asia.</p><p>This is partly attributed to the fact that many more <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/world-population-growth#how-many-people-die-and-how-many-are-born-each-year">babies are born</a> in Asia and Africa than in other regions. But it is also largely the result of the much higher <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/maternal-mortality#how-do-maternal-mortality-rates-compare-around-the-world-today">maternal mortality rates</a> found in lower-income countries. Per birth, a woman in Nigeria is more than 200 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than a woman in Sweden.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths-by-region" class="grapherPreview">

<li><strong>How many mothers would die today if we still had the very poor health of the past?</strong> Even the countries with the best maternal health today had very high maternal mortality rates in the past. In Sweden and Finland in 1800, for example, around <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality?year=1800&amp;time=1800..2015&amp;country=FIN+SWE">900 mothers died</a> for every 100,000 live births [nearly 1-in-100].<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In today&#x2019;s world where <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/annual-number-of-births-by-world-region">140 million</a> women give birth each year this would mean that 1.26 million would die.</li>
<li><strong>The world today</strong>: the actual <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/how-many-women-die-in-childbirth">number of women that died</a> from pregnancy-related causes in 2015 was 302,700.&#xA0;</li>
<li><strong>If all regions had the health of today&#x2019;s best-off countries</strong>: Today the world region with the lowest maternal mortality is the European Union, where <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality?year=1800&amp;time=1990..2015&amp;country=European%20Union">8 women die per 100,000</a> live births.

Almost 300,000 fewer deaths ; a reduction of over 95%.

<section><h2 id="how-has-maternal-mortality-changed-over-the-long-term"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-maternal-mortality-changed-over-the-long-term"></a>How has maternal mortality changed over the long-term?</h2><p>Health complications and mortality risk from childbirth has been a tragic but not uncommon event for mothers throughout history.</p><p>The chart below shows the decline of maternal mortality over the last generations. We see that in the 19th century about 500 to 1,000 mothers died for every 100,000 births. Every 100th to 200th birth led to the mother&#x2019;s death.</p><p>Since <a href="/fertility-rate">women gave birth much more often than today</a> maternal death was not uncommon. This changed over the last century and today most rich countries have a maternal mortality ratio below 10 deaths per 100,000 births &#x2013; the countries with the lowest maternal mortality reached a level of around 1% of the death rate in the 19th century.</p><p>The countries that achieved the lowest maternal mortality ratio are Finland, Greece, Iceland, and Poland. For every 100,000 births, 3 mothers die.</p><p>The 100-fold decline of maternal mortality is due to the modern scientific understanding of the cause of maternal mortality and the adoption of practices which appear surprisingly simple in hindsight.</p><p>We see the decline in Finland over the course of the 2nd half of the 19th century. In the 20th century the availability of antibiotics made it possible to treat cases of puerperal fever and the death of a mother is today fortunately very rare. As it is often the case we see that it is much harder for a pioneer to make advancements than for a country that catches up later. The decline of maternal mortality in Finland began in the middle of the 19th century and didn&#x2019;t reach today&#x2019;s low level more than a century later. Malaysia in contrast achieved this progress in only a few decades.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN+DEU+IRL+JPN+MYS+NLD" class="grapherPreview">

What becomes clear from the map scale &#x2013; spanning orders of magnitude &#x2013; is the extent of cross-country inequality: the magnitude of the differences in mortality between countries are very large. In most high-income countries, maternal mortality is now very low. The average rate in the European Union is 8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. In some countries such as Poland, Greece, Finland and Sweden, the rate is even lower at 3 to 4 per 100,000.</p><p>In Sierra Leone a woman is 300 to 400 times more likely to die with each pregnancy. At an estimated rate of 1360 deaths per 100,000 live births, around 1-in-75 pregnancies ends in the death of the mother.</p><p>The five countries where a woman is most likely to die in a given pregnancy are:</p><ol>
<li>Sierra Leone;</li>
<li>Central African Republic;</li>
<li>Chad;</li>
<li>Nigeria;</li>
<li>and South Sudan.</li>

In Niger, she has <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/children-born-per-woman?tab=chart&amp;time=1950..2019&amp;country=NER">seven children</a>. Not only is the risk per pregnancy <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/maternal-mortality#does-maternal-mortality-fall-as-we-get-richer">higher at lower incomes</a>, but also the <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/fertility-rate#increasing-prosperity-and-structural-transformation-of-the-economy">number of births</a>. Maternal mortality rates <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality-vs-fertility">tend to be higher</a> where women have more children. These amplify the differences in risk between high and low-income countries.</p><p>In the visualization below we see estimates of the share of women that will die from maternal causes in their lifetime, for the country averages. This is based on the probability that a 15-year-old female dies from pregnancy-related causes if fertility and maternal mortality risks stay constant at their current levels.</p><p>Across most of the world, the risk is less than 1%. In most countries, it&#x2019;s even well below 0.1%.</p><p>But, in Sierra Leone, 6% of 15-year-old women today will die from maternal causes sometime in the future, if fertility and maternal mortality rates stay the same. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia it&#x2019;s also over 4%. That&#x2019;s around every 20th woman.</p><p><iframe src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/lifetime-risk-of-maternal-death"></iframe></p></section>

The visualization below shows how common this once was. In Finland &#x2013; the country in which women today have the lowest risk to die from pregnancy-related causes &#x2013; we see that during much of the 19th century, maternal mortality hung between 800 and 1,000 deaths for every 100,000 births. In other words, at each birth women faced a 0.9% chance of death. And since women in Finland <a href="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/total-fertility-rate?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN">gave birth to 5 children</a> on average at the time, this meant that the death of mothers was no rare occurrence.</p><p>The visualization also shows how maternal mortality has changed since then. Starting in the second half of the 19th century, the risk of dying during or after pregnancy has declined from 0.9% to 0.003%. Today, giving birth is 300-times safer than just a few generations ago. How was this possible?</p><p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN+USA+OWID_WRL" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p><h4 id="measurement-and-progress-the-story-of-ignaz-semmelweis"><a class="deep-link" href="#measurement-and-progress-the-story-of-ignaz-semmelweis"></a>Measurement and progress: The story of Ignaz Semmelweis</h4><p>The story of the decline of maternal mortality is a story about scientific research and the importance of measurement. Today medicine makes progress by relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial">randomized controlled trials</a> &#x2013; the history of the decline of maternal mortality started with a kind of controlled trial, one that wasn&#x2019;t planned, but which happened almost accidentally.</p><p>In the mid-19th century, the largest maternity hospital in the world was in Vienna. At the time puerperal sepsis was the most common cause of maternal deaths. This infection of the uterus killed new mothers shortly after childbirth.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p><p>The Vienna Maternity Hospital was divided into two wings and for some time the doctors had noticed a stark difference between the wings that they were not able to explain. Doctors and medical students were taught in the first wing, while midwives were taught in the second. In the first wing, every tenth (!) mother died of puerperal sepsis, while in the second &#x2018;only&#x2019; one in 25 died. Crucially, women were admitted to the clinics not on the basis of how complicated their case was, but simply on alternate days &#x2013; in other words, by random allocation. Unintentionally, the hospital had created the conditions suitable for a natural experiment.</p><p>In 1846, the young Viennese doctor Ignaz Semmelweis was appointed to the hospital. He had the suspicion that the differences in the routine practices of the two wings would give him insight into what was causing the alarmingly high mortality rates in one. He noticed that in the first wing, where 10% of young mothers perished, medical students alternated between helping women to give birth and attending post-mortem examinations of women who had died of puerperal sepsis. They carried out their work in ordinary daytime clothing rather than clean, white coats, and between autopsies and deliveries, they did not wash their hands. By contrast, the pupil midwives in the second clinic did not perform postmortem examinations. And thus, many years before the role of bacteria in diseases was known, Semmelweis concluded that the disease under his study was contagious, and that it was the <em>doctors</em> who were transmitting it.</p><p>Semmelweis also found that a chemical would destroy the agent that led to the disease, and therefore insisted that his students disinfect their hands with it before attending the labour wards. This led to dramatic results. By 1848, the maternal mortality rates of the two clinics in the Vienna Maternity Hospital were comparable.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>However, Semmelweis&#x2019;s insistence on his discovery that puerperal sepsis was contagious did not fit into the accepted medical understanding of the time, and this meant an agonizingly slow process of convincing the medical establishment of the importance of better hygiene and measures of antisepsis. Only in the second half of the 19th century was antisepsis widely introduced into routine obstetric practice. But this change, coupled with the discovery of antibiotics and the development of blood transfusion in the first half of the 20th century, sharply drove down the risk of dying in childbirth.</p><p>Semmelweis&#x2019;s story tells us two things. First, it shows how powerful measurement can be. Decades before the modern germ theory of disease was accepted, and with no understanding of the mechanism that caused puerperal sepsis, it was the measurement of the distribution of maternal deaths that gave Semmelweis the crucial insight about what steps could be taken to effectively reduce maternal mortality. </p><p>Second, it tells us how frustratingly long it can take until new discoveries become accepted and finally change practices. Semmelweis&#x2019;s discovery, which could have led to immediate and widespread improvements, was not widely circulated. More time would have to pass, with more knowledge accumulated, before steep reductions in maternal mortality could take place.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p>We collaborated with the team from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt" target="_blank">Kurz Gesagt</a> and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to tell this history of maternal mortality in a video for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.globalgoals.org/goalkeepers/datareport/" target="_blank">Goalkeepers</a> event in 2017:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ju8yP_ZHR0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><h3 id="what-share-of-births-are-attended-by-health-staff"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-share-of-births-are-attended-by-health-staff"></a>What share of births are attended by health staff?</h3><p>An important factor in a safe delivery for both the mother and baby is good advice, care and supervision by trained medical staff. But not all births are attended by skilled personnel to do so.</p><p>In the first chart below we see the relationship between the maternal mortality rate and the share of births which are attended by skilled health staff. Here we see a strong cluster in the bottom-right corner: this means where the maternal mortality rate is low, almost all births are attended by skilled personnel. But we also see countries with much lower staff coverage: in Chad, for example, only every 5th pregnancy was delivered with trained staff. For countries where health staff coverage was lower, we see that typically maternal mortality was much more likely.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/maternal-mortality-vs-births-attended-by-health-staff" class="grapherPreview">

In the best cases data from the civil registration systems were used directly to calculate the estimates of maternal mortality rates (MMRs). When these data were not available two-part multi-level regression model were used to estimate MMRs for all target years. The three selected predictor variables in the regression model are: GDP, the general fertility rate (GFR) and the proportion of skilled attendants at birth.<br><br></p></section>
