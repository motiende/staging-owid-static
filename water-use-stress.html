This is shown in the chart below.&#xA0; Rates of global freshwater use increased sharply from the 1950s onwards, but since 2000 appears to be plateauing, or at least slowing.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.xyz/grapher/global-freshwater-use-over-the-long-run" class="grapherPreview">

This is even more applicable for particular regions with lower water resources and/or larger population pressures.</p><p>Water stress is defined based on the ratio of freshwater withdrawals to renewable freshwater resources. Water stress does not insinuate that a country has water shortages, but does give an indication of how close it maybe be to exceeding a water basin&#x2019;s renewable resources.

<section><h2 id="definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#definitions"></a>Definitions</h2><h3 id="water-withdrawals"><a class="deep-link" href="#water-withdrawals"></a>Water withdrawals</h3><p><strong>Water withdrawal:&#xA0;</strong>Water withdrawals, ( also sometimes known as &#x2018;water abstractions&#x2019;), are defined as freshwater taken from ground or surface water sources (such as rivers or lakes), either permanently or temporarily, and used for agricultural, industrial or municipal (domestic) uses.</p><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AQUASTAT Database</a> defines&#xA0;<strong>total water withdrawal</strong> as: &#x201C;Annual quantity of water withdrawn for agricultural, industrial and municipal purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It does not include in-stream uses, which are characterized by a very low net consumption rate, such as recreation, navigation, hydropower, inland capture fisheries, etc.&#x201D;</p><p>Total withdrawal is equal to: [withdrawals for agriculture] + [withdrawals for industry] + [withdrawals for municipal/domestic uses].</p><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AQUASTAT Database</a>&#xA0;gives the following definitions for agricultural, industrial and municipal withdrawals:</p><p><strong>Agricultural water withdrawal</strong>: &#x201C;Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Industrial water withdrawal</strong>: &#x201C;Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial uses. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%. It includes water for the cooling of thermoelectric and nuclear power plants, but it does not include hydropower. Water withdrawn by industries that are connected to the public supply network is generally included in municipal water withdrawal.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Municipal water withdrawal</strong>: &#x201C;Annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for the direct use by the population. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries and urban agriculture, which is connected to the municipal network. The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas.&#x201D;</p><h3 id="definitions-water-stress-and-scarcity"><a class="deep-link" href="#definitions-water-stress-and-scarcity"></a>Water stress and scarcity</h3><p><strong>Renewable internal freshwater resources</strong> refers to the quantity of internal freshwater from inflowing river basins and recharging groundwater aquifers. Data on renewable resources should be treated with caution; since this data is gathered intermittently, it fails to capture seasonal and annual variance in water resources which can be significant in some nations. Data at a national level also fails to capture variability at more local levels, which can be important when analysing the sustainability of particular groundwater aquifers or surface water basins.</p><p><strong>Water stress</strong> is defined in its simplest terms as occurring when&#xA0;water demand or withdrawal substantiates a large share of renewable water resources. The World Resources Institute (WRI) define baseline water stress based on the ratio of annual water withdrawals to renewable resources.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>It defines water stress categories based on this percentage (% of withdrawals to renewable resources) as follows:</p><ul>
<li>&lt;10% = low stress</li>
<li>10-20% = low-to-medium stress</li>
<li>20-40% = medium-to-high stress</li>
<li>40-80% = high stress</li>
<li>&gt;80% = extremely high stress</li>
</ul><p><strong>Water scarcity&#xA0;</strong>is more extreme than water stress, and occurs when water demand exceeds internal water resources.</p></section>
